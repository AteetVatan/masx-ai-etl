August 22, 2025e-Paper Published- August 22, 2025 04:52 pm IST - Lahore Supporters of Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan block a highway, during a protest against his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, May 9, 2023. File | Photo Credit: Reuters Pakistan's Punjab police on Friday (August 22, 2025) confirmed that incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan's nephew Shahrez Khan has been arrested in connection with theMay 9, 2023 riots casesand not abducted as claimed. Also Read |Pakistan Supreme Court grants bail to Imran Khan in May 9 violence cases Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in a statement on Thursday (August 21, 2025) claimed that Shahrez Khan was abducted from his home here. “Punjab police have arrested Shahrez Khan. He was wanted in connection with the May 9 cases and will be produced before a court today,” DIG Investigation Zeeshan Raza said in a statement. “Those involved in anti-state activities do not deserve any leniency,” he said. Imran Khan's close aide Zulfi Bokhari late on Thursday night said, “Cowards in civilian clothing attacked Aleema Khanum's (Imran's sister) house. They beat up the poor staff and abducted her son Shahrez Khan, who has nothing to do with politics.” “These are new lows of brutal fascism. We strongly condemn this appalling act. Disgraceful cowards,” he said. “Shahrez Khan, who is an international athlete, was abducted from his bedroom after breaking the doors of the house -- the servants were subjected to brutal violence and Shahrez Khan was tortured in front of his two innocent children after forcibly entering the room,” the PTI said. Aleema Khan has been openly criticising the military establishment. Earlier, she had told the media that Imran Khan asked his party members to hold Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir accountable if anything happens to him in jail. The 72-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been behind bars since August 2023 after he was booked in multiple cases. Ali Amin Gandapur, a senior PTI leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, took to X to condemn the incident and demanded Sharez’s immediate release. “The abduction of Aleema Khan’s son Shahrez from her home by men in plain clothes is despicable,” he lambasted. Shahrez graduated from Oxford University and at present, he works as the regional head at Simba Global, a big linen supplier based in Australia and is also a triathlete. Imran Khan's other nephew Hassan Niazi is convicted by the military court in case related to May 9, 2023, when Khan's party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad, some 130 kms from Lahore. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time, protesting Khan's arrest.

        "raw_text": "Islamabad, Aug 22 (IANS) Pakistan's global rhetoric on free speech appears empty as its hypocrisy is exposed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), where the word “free” is nothing more than a cruel irony, a report has cited. “The plight of young blogger and poet Asma Batool offers a stark example. Her ‘crime’ was penning a poem highlighting the harassment and sexual violence women endure in society. Rather than sparking debate, her verses provoked outrage from local clerics, who branded them ‘blasphemous’, a report in the UK-based media outlet Milli Chronicle detailed. “Within days, Batool was arrested under draconian laws, while a frenzied mob attacked her home for allegedly ‘insulting Allah’. Instead of protecting her right to expression, authorities capitulated to hardliners—turning a poet’s pen into grounds for imprisonment,” it added. According to the report, the silencing of dissent in PoK is part of a wider pattern. It stated that in Neelum Valley, journalist Hayat Awan, along with activists Wasi Khawaja and Azhar Mughal, were detained for voicing concerns over a military-run arms training program for female students. Their criticism, shared in a handful of social media posts, was branded intolerable. “The message from authorities was unmistakable: questioning the military or its activities remains off-limits. Even as local press clubs staged protests demanding their release, the detained voices remained behind bars, underscoring the futility of challenging Pakistan’s entrenched power structures,” the report highlighted. It emphasised that Pakistan’s worsening freedom of press has not gone unnoticed, as in 2025, the country’s ranking plummeted to 158 out of 180 countries, the lowest position ever. International watchdogs, the report stated, have pointed to an atmosphere of fear, intimidation, and arbitrary arrests that have left journalists exposed to pressure from both state and non-state actors. Despite its dismal record, the report stated Pakistan continues to project itself as a guardian of free expression abroad, with officials condemning censorship in other countries and portraying themselves as defenders of civil liberties on global platforms. However, for those living under Pakistan’s direct control, particularly in PoK, it stated that freedom of speech remains a dangerous illusion. “The contradiction is stark: poets jailed for poems, journalists arrested for social media posts, and activists punished for questioning militarization. Pakistan’s actions in PoK reveal a deeper reality—its proclaimed values crumble when tested at home,” the report noted. --IANS scor/as IANS India Private LimitedA-6, Ground Floor, Block ASector-16, Noida, Uttar PradeshPhone:+91-120-4822400, 4822415, 4822416Email:,",

        "description": "Pakistan : Rights group warns of surging violence against religious minorities",
        "raw_text": "Pakistan: Rights group warns of surging violence against religious minorities Islamabad:A leading minority rights group has raised serious concerns over the escalating violence and systemic persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, warning that Christians, Hindus, Ahmadiyyas, Sikhs, and others continue to face increasing marginalisation, targeted attacks, and social exclusion under the country’s prevailing religious intolerance. Citing a latest report by the Washington-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), the Voice of Pakistan Minority (VOPM) said findings revealed that the state of religious freedom in Pakistan is “increasingly dire.” The report noted that despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, minorities in Pakistan live under constant threat, with little hope of justice. The VOPM asserted that central to this persecution is Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy law, which has been widely misused to intimidate, settle personal disputes, or extort money. It added that accusations alone—whether true or fabricated—are often enough to spark mob violence against religious minorities in the country. “Hindus, Pakistan’s largest minority, continue to face violence and forced conversions. In 2019, a blasphemy accusation against Hindu teacher Notan Lal in Sindh triggered riots: Hindu shops were looted, a school ransacked, and a temple attacked. Though Lal was acquitted in 2024, his case is a reminder of how quickly allegations can ignite communal violence. In 2020, a historic temple in Karak was torched by a mob protesting its expansion, despite Supreme Court orders for protection,” read a statement issued by the rights body. According to VOPM, women and girls from minority communities often face persecution in the form of abduction and forced conversion, with the CSOH report noting that Hindu and Christian girls are particularly at risk. Highlighting the atrocities against minorities in Pakistan, the rights body stated that in December 2024, a 15-year-old Hindu girl, Kajol was abducted from her home in Sindh province, and then tortured, raped, converted, and forced into marriage. Her name was changed to “Javeriya,” and her age was falsified to make the marriage appear legal. Despite appeals from her family, the VOPM said she remains trapped with her abductors. Additionally, the rights body mentioned that in March 2024, a 10-year-old Christian girl, Laiba, was kidnapped from her home in Punjab province, forcibly converted to Islam, and married to her 35-year-old abductor, while documents were falsified to show she was 17. Instead of returning her to her parents, a Pakistani court ordered that she be kept in a state-run shelter. Similarly, raising concern over the violence faced by minority men as well, the VOPM stated that in March 2025, Hindu sanitation worker Nadeem Naath was shot dead in Peshawar after refusing to convert to Islam. In the same month, it said 22-year-old Christian labourer Waqas Masih survived an attack by his supervisor, who slit his throat after pressuring him to abandon his faith. “The persecution of Pakistan’s minorities is not only a political and legal issue—it is a deeply human tragedy. It is about families who lose their homes overnight, young girls robbed of their childhoods, and entire communities forced to live in fear,” the VOPM stated. “And yet, amid this fear, these communities show remarkable resilience. Christians continue to rebuild burned churches, Hindus fight for their temples, Ahmadiyyas stand firm in their faith, and Sikhs strive to keep their culture alive,” it added.

        "raw_text": "Islamabad, Aug 22 (IANS) Pakistan’s intelligence and security apparatus plans to push certain strategic anti-India narratives during the upcoming visit of Indian Sikh pilgrims, or “jathas,” to the country, a report has cited. “Social media chatter points to an inter-agency meeting held on August 2 at Hotel Gulbarg in Lahore, attended by representatives from security agencies, the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC). While the security agencies reportedly floated the idea of using anti-India banners and slogans at Gurdwaras, both the ETPB and PSGPC strongly opposed the proposal,” a report in ‘Khalsa Vox’ mentioned. The report stated that an ETPB Additional Secretary warned that politicising the pilgrimage might prompt India to suspend such visits indefinitely, a setback the financially-struggling boards can hardly afford. It highlighted that social media posts claim the ETPB has already incurred losses of nearly 70 million Pakistani rupees per month since the closure of the Kartarpur Corridor on May 8, a blow further compounded by the cancellation of two major annual Sikh pilgrimages. According to the report, the ETPB official emphasised that religious events must remain apolitical, adding that pilgrim schedules are already managed in coordination with multiple government and security agencies. He added that while the ETPB would follow federal directives, it was equally important to uphold the sanctity of religious gatherings. Despite resistance, security agencies have reportedly proposed seminars and interactions near the pilgrims’ accommodations to promote their fake narratives. This includes \"Indian discrimination against Sikhs, the alleged targetting of Gurdwaras in India, and other contentious claims. Social media posts describe a strategy to amplify these messages via Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok during the pilgrimage,” the report detailed. “Commentary online suggests that Pakistan may be seeking to tap into historical grievances, perceived economic marginalization, and disinformation to sway segments of the Sikh diaspora. Analysts quoted in these posts see the continued intertwining of religious access with political agendas as a calculated — but risky — approach,\" the report noted. --IANS scor/as IANS India Private LimitedA-6, Ground Floor, Block ASector-16, Noida, Uttar PradeshPhone:+91-120-4822400, 4822415, 4822416Email:,",

        "raw_text": "Two J&K govt employees dismissed for anti-national activities Srinagar:Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha on Friday dismissed two government employees from service for their alleged involvement in militancy-related activities. The terminated employees have been identified as Khurshid Ahmed Rather, a teacher posted in Karnah of Kupwara district and Siyad Ahmad Khan, a stock assistant in the Sheep Husbandry Department posted in Keran area of the same district. Officials said that both these government employees were found to be working for the proscribed outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). “Law enforcement and intelligence agencies had reportedly gathered incriminating evidence establishing their links with the outfit before action was taken under the provisions of law,” officials said. The terminations were carried out under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, which empowers the government to dismiss employees without an inquiry if deemed necessary in the interest of the security of the state. The government has intensified its crackdown on government employees suspected of links with terrorist groups, with dozens terminated since 2021 under similar provisions. The terminated employee, Khurshid Ahmad Rather, was appointed in government service as Rehbar-e-Taleem (ReT) in the School Education Department in 2003 and got confirmed as a teacher in 2008. He was posted at Government Primary School, Maindpora Nawa Gabra, Kupwara. Presently, he is under suspension since his arrest on January 26, 2024 and is lodged at District Jail, Kupwara. He is listed in police records as a terrorist associate/Overground Worker (OGW) of the LeT. Officials said that despite being employed and paid by the government to serve in the education department, Rather violated this trust and chose to secretly associate himself with LeT. ”Rather than fulfilling his duties of imparting education to the children of the remote district of Jammu and Kashmir, he became actively involved in subversive activities aimed at harming the state and became an active conduit for terrorist activities sponsored by LeT. His actions were not merely passive or incidental; he played a deliberate and dangerous role in furthering the objectives of a terrorist network that is committed to destabilising the region and attacking the sovereignty of the Indian state,” the officials said. “On 25.01.2024, Police Kupwara received credible information that two POJK-based terrorists of the LeT outfit, Manzoor Ahmad Sheikh alias Shakoor (Kashmiri Native Operative from Pakistan) and Qazi Mohammad Khushal (Kashmiri Native Operative from Pakistan) were involved in smuggling arms, ammunition and explosives from across the border into Indian territory. This operation was being facilitated through their local associates, Khurshid Ahmad Rather, Zahoor Ahmad Bhat, Ghulam Sarwar Rather and Qazi Fazal of Karnah, Kupwara with the objective of promoting terrorism in J&K and other parts of the country,” the officials added. A case FIR No. 07/2024 under section 120-B IPC, 13, 18, 20, 23, 38, 39 UA(P) Act was registered in Police Station Karnah Kupwara. The other dismissed employee, Siyad Ahmad Khan Rather, has been conducting his activities in a very secret and veiled manner to avoid the suspicion of security forces. ”Pursuant to his subversive anti-national activities, on 12.01.2024, while he was on one such mission to supply arms and ammunition to the terrorists of LeT was intercepted at Peer Baba Shrine, Keran by a naka party of police and army. On search, one AK-47 was recovered from his possession, and one pistol, one pistol Magazine and five pistol rounds were recovered from his associate, Rafaqat Ahmad Khan,” said the officials. The recovery of these arms and ammunition in the case clearly reflected the depth of Khan’s engagement in unlawful activities. “Upon this, case FIR No. 02/2024 under sections 7/25 Arms Act, 13 UA(P) Act was registered at Police Station Keran, Kupwara”, officials added.

        "raw_text": "Agnihotri’s latest film isn’t art—it’s propaganda that distorts history, vilifies Gopal Patha, and weaponizes cinema for politics. Vivek Agnihotri is not making films—he is manufacturing venom.The Bengal Filesis not art; it is political propaganda, carefully packaged to inflame, distort, and divide. By dragging the name of Gopal Chandra Mukhopadhyay—popularly known as Gopal Patha—into this cesspool, Agnihotri has crossed the line between artistic license and malicious slander. Gopal Patha was no “butcher.” He was a wrestler, a freedom fighter, and, above all, a protector. In the chaos of 1946, when Calcutta burned under the horrors of Direct Action Day—engineered by the Muslim League and abetted by the then chief minister H.S. Suhrawardy—it was Gopal who mobilized Hindus not for indiscriminate slaughter, but for defense. His orders were crystal clear: women, children, and innocents must not be harmed. He stood as a bulwark against the barbarity unleashed on Hindus—massacres, rapes, kidnappings, and arson—and in doing so prevented Calcutta from collapsing entirely to Suhrawardy’s Pakistan-backed plans. Yet Agnihotri, intoxicated by his own false bravado, chooses to depict this man as a “Muslim-hating butcher.” A grotesque lie, one his own grandson has condemned as“belittling, dehumanising and demonising.”The family has filed legal action, and rightly so. To smear a man who fought to keep Calcutta from drowning in blood is not only dishonest—it is vile. And let’s not pretend the timing is innocent. With Bengal elections around the corner, the film slots neatly into a political narrative. Agnihotri plays martyr when his trailer launch is disrupted, whining about “freedom of expression,” all while peddling half-truths and communal venom. Expression is not license to falsify history or profit from hate. History is brutal, yes—but it is also sacred. Direct Action Day is one of the darkest chapters of Partition: a pre-planned pogrom against Hindus, encouraged by Jinnah’s chilling declaration,“India divided or India burned.”Hindu neighborhoods were torched, men slaughtered, women raped, and young girls paraded as trophies of fanaticism. Suhrawardy gave rioters free rein, and mobs led by criminals like Munna Chaudhary and Meena Punjabi terrorized Calcutta with unspeakable crimes. Police records tell of hacked and naked bodies of Hindu girls hanging in slaughterhouses. Against this carnage rose Gopal Patha and his Bharat Jatiya Bahini, uniting Hindus across castes and regions, arming themselves with whatever they could find—knives, spears, pistols, acid bombs. Their resistance was targeted: they fought back the very mobs that had butchered innocents, and they never touched Muslim women or children. By August 20, Suhrawardy’s dream of tearing Calcutta into Pakistan’s fold had collapsed. This is history—ugly, raw, undeniable. And yet, Agnihotri’s so-called film trashes it. Instead of portraying Gopal as the man who saved countless Hindus and defended his city, he twists him into a caricature—a hate-spewing villain—for cheap applause and electoral mileage. Let’s call it what it is:The Bengal Filesis a disgrace. It reduces suffering into a circus, exploits grief for profit, and poisons public discourse. Art is meant to confront, to illuminate, to humanise. This is the opposite: cowardly, manipulative, toxic storytelling that tears apart the very fabric of society. India does not need more of this garbage. It needs truth, courage, and integrity—values Gopal Patha lived and died for. Agnihotri, on the other hand, has chosen distortion, division, and disgrace. Shame on those who dignify this poison by calling it cinema. © Brandbuzz Multimedia Private Limited",

        "description": "Confession : Defence Minister roasts Asim Munir over India Ferrari , Pak dumpster remark",
        "raw_text": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday ridiculed Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir’s bizarre attempt tocompare India with a luxury carand his own country with a dump truck, saying the remark itself was nothing but a confession of Pakistan’s failure. “Everyone said that if two countries gained independence at the same time, and one country, through hard work, sound policies, and foresight, built an economy like a Ferrari, while the other is still in the state of a dumper, then it is their own failure. I also see this statement by Asim Munir as a confession,” Rajnath Singh said at an Economic Times event. His remark came in response to Asim Munir's comments earlier this month. Munir made what he himself described as a “crude analogy” while speaking at an event in Florida. “India is shining Mercedes coming on a highway like Ferrari [sic], but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?” he asked, in remarks that drew widespread trolling on social media. Many internet users pointed out that his words made Pakistan look bad and amounted to an inadvertent admission of India’s progress outpacing Pakistan’s. Munir's metaphor ended up sounding more like self-goal than strategy. The Defence Minister, however, went a step further, saying Munir’s analogy reflected a deeper problem with Pakistan’s mindset. “The Chief of the Pakistan Army, knowingly or unknowingly, has pointed towards a robber mentality, which Pakistan has been a victim of since its birth...We must break this delusion of the Pakistani Army,” Rajnath Singh said. Asim Munir has made several controversial remarks targeting India over the past month, including issuing nuclear threats during the same US trip. At a black-tie dinner in Tampa hosted by businessman and honorary consul Adnan Asad, Munir said, “We are a nuclear nation. If we think we are going down, we’ll take half the world down with us.” India tore into Pakistan and Asim Munir, pointing out that “nuclear sabre-rattling” was Pakistan’s “stock-in-trade” and reinforced doubts over “the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.” The government further pointed out the fact that Munir’s comments were made from the soil of a friendly third country, calling them “highly irresponsible” and “a real danger to regional and global security.” Pakistan then attempted to do damage control, describing itself as a“responsible nuclear weapon state”and claiming that Munir's comments were “distorted out of context.” New Delhi has meanwhile repeatedly emphasised that the country will continue to take all steps necessary to safeguard its national security. - EndsPublished By:Anuja JhaPublished On:Aug 22, 2025Must Watch",

        "raw_text": "Pakistani authorities have registered cases under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) against four female journalists, including the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) Secretary, for discussing a private issue involving an NPC member in a shared WhatsApp group. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliate, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), condemn the arbitrary registration of the legal cases and call for their swift withdrawal. Cases have been registered under Pakistan Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) against four female journalists for discussing a private issue in a shared WhatsApp group. Credit: Justin Tallis / AFP The Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cyber Crime Reporting Center registered a First Information Report (FIR) on February 27, 2025, under Section 21/1(d) of the PECA and Sections 506(II), 34, and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code in response to a complaint filed by Nasir Khan Khattak, who is currently engaged in a dispute with his partner, NPC member Salma Shahid. The FIR alleges that Shahid shared details of the private disagreement with fellow NPC members in a WhatsApp group titled ‘NPC Women Journalists Caucus’, created by the press club’s Secretary Nayar Ali. In total, four women journalists are named in the case, including Shahid, Ali, and group administrators Sehrish Qureshi and Mayra Imran. The FIR also implicates all 171 group members. According to the Women’s Media Forum Pakistan (WMFP), the cases wereregisteredby the FIA without allowing the four journalists to present any counter explanation. The WMFP said the FIR was an “alarming attempt to silence women journalists and restrict their right to free expression and association.” Since passing in 2016, the IFJ and PFUJcriticisedthe PECA’s impact on freedom of expression and access to information, with journalists, activists, and political opponents targeted under the law and the government enforcing frequent shutdowns of online platforms. Recentamendmentsto the cybercrime law, passed in Pakistan’s National Assembly on January 23, widened PECA’s scope to further restrict online freedom of expression, enable further regulatory control of content, and grant additional government powers to oversee social media platforms. The PFUJ said:“PFUJ does not support filing cases under the controversial PECA. We urge the authorities to ensure justice.” The IFJ said:“Journalists must not be criminalised for performing their professional duties or exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression. The IFJ urges Pakistan’s government to repeal the PECA’s draconian provisions and ensure it cannot be misused as a tool to silence the media and suppress press freedom.” For further information contact IFJ Asia - Pacific on[email protected] The IFJ represents more than 600,000 journalists in 140 countries Twitter:@ifjasiapacific, on Facebook:IFJAsiaPacificandInstagram 15Sep2025 On International Democracy Day, Global Union Federations (GUFs), including the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), condemn the Myanmar… 11Sep2025 Three journalists were allegedly attacked at a press conference held by Aleema Khan, the sister of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, in… 09Sep2025 Four journalists were injured in Kathmandu on September 8 during violent clashes with police over the country’s controversial social media bill and… The International Federation of Journalists is the global voice of journalists.

The Chandrabhaga Lake is a wide and large water body in Assar village, extending till Dharmound in Ramban district. The stagnant water resembles a frozen bowl of basil-green soup. Situated on the left bank of the river, Assar, with its fertile agricultural fields, is called “the vegetable basket” of the Chenab Valley. Apart from the luxuriant fields of maize and wheat, nearly twenty varieties of vegetables are grown here. The vegetable production as a commercial crop came to Assar in 1960, when a West Pakistan refugee (WPR) named Mulkh Raj came to the village. He distributed seeds and fertilisers to the farmers and encouraged vegetable production. However, this started the circle of exploitation of the small growers, as Mulkh Raj would become the first commission agent, an intermediary between the farmers of Assar and the markets of Jammu. The system of commission agents became stronger over the years, making the grower poorer and the wholesale merchant and agent richer. The vegetables, if not sold in time, would rot, giving no choice to the farmers but to sell at whatever low price they were offered. “You will be left with no choice but to throw your vegetables in the Chenab,” the commission agents would warn them. Aware of the exploitation, the farmers of Assar have been demanding for cold storage to escape the sinister clutches of the commission agents and traders who push them into distress sales. Road traffic accidents on the Kishtwar–Batote road have been common. Many a times a whole bus plunges down the river, killing dozens, destroying families and clans. The surety of death is perceived as a foregone conclusion each time a vehicle comes in contact with the water of the Chenab. In December 2022, an Alto car rolled down from the highway and plunged into the Chenab. On the bank of the river, two identity cards, a driving license and a purse were found. The car was retrieved from the river, but there was no trace of any luggage or the occupants of the car. Police investigation identified Manjeet Singh, a small-time contractor from Bhaderwah and his wife and six-year-old daughter as the occupants of the ill-fated vehicle. In no time, the smiling photograph of the young couple with their cute daughter in pigtails found its way on social media. A plethora of heartfelt comments and condolences poured in for the family. Some netizens even cursed the Chenab for having yet again gulped innocent souls. The police continued to look for the bodies and investigate the case. It was later found that Manjeet Singh was under heavy debt as he had taken a loan of Rs 30 lakh from different banks and private lenders. Unable to pay the debts, he staged the accident. Twenty days later, the family was traced in Panchkula, Haryana, where they had been living with changed identities. The Chenab moves forward from the lake and passes underneath Dharmound. Soon appears the panoramic view of the river flowing by the bowl of Chanderkote on one side and the Chandrabhaga lake on the other. Meanwhile, just behind the river, the pine forests seem to climb up a mountain, ensconcing the highway town of Batote in nature’s green lap. There are a large number of Sikhs residing in Batote. The first batch arrived with Sant Rocha Singh. Rocha Singh was born to Brahmin parents in Pakistan. He was barely fourteen years old when his father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and younger brother. The tall and handsome Rocha Singh chanced to meet Guru Gobind Singh in 1705. That meeting changed him forever. He spent the rest of his life in the company of saints. For his dedication, Rocha Singh was taken into the Khalsa fold, and it is presumed that he travelled all over Jammu and Kashmir to spread the message of Sikhism. More Sikhs settled in Batote, escaping the communal frenzy of 1947. A gurudwara in the town, erected in the memory of Sant Rocha Singh, is a place for pilgrimage. Nestled amidst green hills, Batote is famous for its natural beauty and exotic migratory birds. Due to its salubrious environs, blessed with pleasant weather and fresh air, it is also considered to be a natural health resort. In the 1930s, the Batote Hospital became a recuperating centre for patients of tuberculosis. The hospital, located amidst a copse of pine trees, was considered to be a perfect spot for rejuvenation. In 1935, Saadat Hasan Manto was admitted here. Manto, with his paternal roots in Kashmir and maternal lineage in Afghanistan, was born in Ludhiana in 1912 into a family of legal luminaries. In 1934, he joined the Aligarh Muslim University to pursue graduation. However, his education at the university was cut short as he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He spent three months for his treatment in the Batote sanatorium. After regaining his health in the healing surroundings, Manto returned home. Undoubtedly, the fresh breeze blowing across the pines on the Chenab’s banks played its role. There is nothing to prove if his stay in Batote influenced his writing or not, but he eventually became one of the finest writers in the Urdu language and matured into a celebrated playwright, artistic essayist and a story-writer. On an early morning in September 2019, not far from the sanatorium, gunfire and explosions shattered the peace of Batote. Even during the peak of militancy in the Chenab Valley, Batote had largely remained peaceful. However, being situated on the highway, it has been a transit point for the militants entering surreptitiously into Jammu city or moving towards the Kashmir Valley. Earlier in the day, a group of three terrorists had emerged from the forests on the Doda-Batote highway. Two of them hid behind the trees and took positions while the third came on the road and signalled a vehicle to stop. The driver of the vehicle, displaying great presence of mind, sped away. On the way, he saw an army vehicle and informed them about the armed militant on the roadside. When the army vehicle approached the spot, it came under heavy fire. In a short time, enforcements arrived and the hot pursuit of the terrorists began. The security forces cordoned off the house and plugged all exit routes. The terrorists released the women but kept the tailor captive. Frenetic appeals made on a public address system, asking the militants to surrender, failed. A fierce gunfight ensued, and the tailor was freed. After the encounter, three dead bodies with weapons and ammunition were recovered. The house was pockmarked by gunfire and one portion was extensively damaged by the blasts. The terrorists were identified as Osama Javed and Zahid – both from Kishtwar – and Moin-ul-Islam. Son of a school teacher, Osama belonged to Sonder village in Marwah. Hizbul Mujahideen had assigned him the task of reviving militancy in Kishtwar. He was able to recruit Zahid from his own village and, with the help of some overground workers, established a few hideouts in Kishtwar. In November 2018, the militants struck right in the middle of Kishtwar town. The Parihar brothers, who ran a stationery shop, closed rather late one night and headed for home on foot. A militant appeared out of the blue and shot them dead at point-blank range. Ajeet Parihar, the elder brother, was the secretary of the BJP and one of most recognizable faces in the town. For the last three decades, he had brazenly condemned militancy and would fiercely lead the protests against Hindu killings. After the Chapnari massacre of 1998, he had made a fiery speech that moved even Home Minister Advani, who had visited Premnagar. The murders of Parihar brothers was followed by a few incidents of weapon snatching from the government forces. These incidents baffled the police and the locals alike. It became clear that there was a militant group operating in town that would plan and audaciously carry out attacks and then evaporate into thin air without any trace. After sieving through a large data of Internet traffic and call detail records (CDRs), a few numbers were marked as suspicious. Finally, the investigators zeroed in on a house within Kishtwar town. By the time the policemen were able to discover the hideout – a secret pit dug on the terrace of a house – the terrorists had escaped, leaving behind a few blankets and some ammunition. The interrogation of the owner of the house led to a local boy named Nissar Ahmed. He had ostensibly transported the terrorists in his auto rickshaw during the murders of the Parihar brothers and Chandarkant Sharma. After a few more arrests, the name of Moin-ul-Islam came up, who had joined Osama and Zahid a month earlier. Hizbul Mujahideen had specially sent Moin-ul-Islam from Shopian for a suicide mission. He had been tasked to kill the most prominent BJP leader in the town. Due to the high security of the intended victim, a suicide mission was the only way to kill him. The police crackdown in Kishtwar had rendered Osama and his accomplices helpless; the security forces were closing in on them. Having been on the run for a few weeks, the militants decided to leave Kishtwar and move to Kashmir with the help of Moin-ul-Islam. Though it is not clear how they reached Batote, it is possible that they were helped by someone. It was later learnt that they wanted to hijack a vehicle to move to Kashmir and ended up in the local tailor’s house, which became their grave.

        "raw_text": ": सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने दिल्ली-एनसीआर के आवारा कुत्तों को सड़कों से हटाने के अपने आदेश में संशोधन किया है। कोर्ट ने पहले आवारा कुत्तों को शेल्टर होम्स में बंद करने का आदेश दिया गया था। गुरुवार को तीन जजों की बेंच ने निर्देश दिया कि जिन कुत्तों को पकड़ा गया है, उन्हें छोड़ दिया जाए। कोर्ट ने इस दौरान यह भी कहा कि आवारा कुत्तों की समस्या दिल्ली ही नहीं पूरे देश में है। हालांकि आवारा कुत्तों के लोगों को काटने की समस्या देश से भी आगे यानी दुनियाभर में है। विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन के अनुसार, रेबीज के कारण 150 से ज्यादा देशों, खासकर अफ्रीका और एशिया में हर साल अनुमानित 59,000 लोगों की मौत होती है। भारत में यह बीमारी हर साल 18,000 से 20,000 लोगों की जान लेती है। इसमें 15 साल से कम उम्र के बच्चों की संख्या 30-60% होती है। रेबीज से होने वाली 99 प्रतिशत मौतें कुत्तों के काटने से होती हैं। जाहिर है कि यह समस्या वैश्विक है। ऐसे में हमें जानना चाहिए कि दुनिया के अलग-अलग देश इस समस्या से कैसे निपट रहे हैं।यूरोपीय देश नीदरलैंड ने आवारा कुत्तों के लिए एक व्यापक नीति बनाई है। इसमें सरकार के वित्त पोषित CNVR (संग्रह, नसबंदी, टीकाकरण, वापसी) कार्यक्रम में आवारा कुत्तों की नसबंदी और टीकाकरण किया जाता है। पालतू कुत्तों के लिए भी में ये सुविधा है। नियमों का पालन ना करने वालों पर भारी जुर्माना, सख्त क्रूरता-विरोधी कानून और कानून प्रवर्तन के लिए एक समर्पित पशु कल्याण यूनिट है। यह यूनिट ध्यान रखती है कि कुत्तों को टीका लगे।मोरक्को में हर साल करीब एक लाख लोगों को कुत्ते काटते हैं। मोरक्को सरकार ने 2019 में ट्रैप-न्यूटर-वैक्सीनेट-रिलीज (TNVR) कार्यक्रम शुरू किया। इसमें आवारा कुत्तों को पकड़कर उनकी नसबंदी करना और रेबीज का टीका लगाना और फिर पहचान टैग के साथ वापस छोड़ना शामिल है। मोरक्को सरकार ने आवारा कुत्तों से निपटने के लिए 10 करोड़ डॉलर से 130 सामुदायिक स्वच्छता कार्यालय खोले है। इनमें 60 डॉक्टर, 260 नर्स, 260 स्वास्थ्य तकनीशियन और 130 पशु चिकित्सक हैं।कंबोडिया में सरकार ने बड़े पैमाने पर कुत्तों के टीकाकरण अभियान के जरिए महत्वपूर्ण सफलता हासिल की है। देश में केवल दो हफ्तों के भीतर 2.2 लाख कुत्तों को रेबीज का टीका लगाया गया है। इस टीकाकरण अभियान का उद्देश्य रेबीज के संचरण को सीमित करना है। यह प्रतिक्रियात्मक उपायों के बजाय एक निवारक, जन स्वास्थ्य-केंद्रित दृष्टिकोण को दर्शाता है।विश्व पशु स्वास्थ्य संगठन के अनुसार, भूटान ने कुत्तों से निपटने में कमाल किया है। कुत्ता जनसंख्या प्रबंधन और रेबीज नियंत्रण कार्यक्रम के तहत भूटान आवारा कुत्तों की 100 प्रतिशत नसबंदी करने वाला पहला देश है। यह कार्यक्रम मार्च 2022 में शुरू हुआ और अक्टूबर 2023 में 3.55 मिलियन डॉलर की लागत से पूरा हुआ। तीन चरणों में 1500 कर्मियों ने कुल 61,680 कुत्तों की नसबंदी की।तुर्की ने लाखों आवारा कुत्तों को हटाने के लिए एक मानवीय कानून बनाया है। इसके तहत नगरपालिकाओं को कुत्तों को आश्रय देना, उनका टीकाकरण करना, उनकी नसबंदी करना और उन्हें गोद लेने की पेशकश करना अनिवार्य है। इसमें कुत्तों को मारने की अनुमति केवल खतरनाक बीमारी होने पर है।आवारा कुत्तों के लोगों और बच्चों को काटने की समस्या पाकिस्तान में भी है। हालांकि पाकिस्तान ने इससे निपटने के लिए तुर्की या भूटान की तरह मानवीय तरीका नहीं अपनाया। पाकिस्तान के पंजाब प्रांत में आवारा कुत्तों के हमले बढ़ने बाद अधिकारियों ने इस साल मार्च में दो हफ्तों के भीतर 1,000 आवारा कुत्तों को मार डाला। रिजवान, नवभारत टाइम्स ऑनलाइन में चीफ सीनियर डिजिटल कंटेंट प्रोड्यूसर हैं। पत्रकारिता में उनका करीब 10 वर्षों का अनुभव है। वह इंटरेशनल अफेयर्स (वर्ल्ड सेक्शन) कवर कर रहे हैं। अमर उजाला के साथ डिजिटल पारी की शुरुआत की और फिर वन इंडिया हिंदी, राजस्थान पत्रिका से होते हुए नवभारत टाइम्स में है। उन्‍होंने चौधरी चरण सिंह विश्वविद्यालय और भारतीय जनसंचार संस्थान से पढ़ाई की है। की ताजा खबरें, ब्रेकिंग न्यूज, अनकही और सच्ची कहानियां, सिर्फ खबरें नहीं उसका विश्लेषण भी। इन सब की जानकारी, सबसे पहले और सबसे सटीक हिंदी में देश के सबसे लोकप्रिय, सबसे भरोसेमंद",

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit will be held in Tianjin on August 31 and September 1, 2025. | Photo Credit: Reuters It is important to have regional solidarity amid turbulence in international landscape, China said on Friday (August 22, 2025) as it prepared to host heads of states and international organisations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin on August 31 and September 1. Chinese President Xi Jinping will chair the summit, which is expected to be attended by a host of world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Briefing reporters about the summit, China’s Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Bin said it will follow new visions to overcome “cultural wars and cold war mentality”, while looking into new measures to advance development, maintain security, and promote prosperity. The meeting, hosting more than 20 world leaders from countries including Belarus, Armenia, Malaysia, Nepal, Türkiye, and Egypt, comes against the backdrop of uncertainties in global trade, triggered by the tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. “In today’s world, outdated mindsets of hegemonism and power politics still have influence, with certain countries attempting to prioritise their own interests above others, seriously threatening world peace and stability,” Mr. Liu said without naming any specific country while emphasising on the need to strengthen regional cooperation. The SCO aims at stability to foster lasting peace, harmony, and friendship while addressing uncertainties in international environment, Mr. Liu said, adding that the summit will focus on practising multilateralism and safeguarding regional stability.

        "description": "Pakistan : Imran Khan nephew arrested in May 9 case",
        "raw_text": "The Lahore Police on Thursday arrested Shahrez Khan, the nephew of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a case related to the May 9 violence. An anti-terrorism court later handed him to the police for eight days of custody. Following Imran’s arrest in May 2023, his party Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI) held nationwide protests on May 9 that turned violent. His supporters stormed several Pakistani military installations, including official residences of army commanders and the Army headquarters in Rawalpindi. That’s known as the ‘May 9 case’. The police have accused Shahrez of being part of the attack on Jinnah House, the official residence of the Corps Commander of the Pakistan Army’s 4 Corps in Lahore, on May 9, 2023 — he has been arrested after more than two years of the alleged offence. The Express Tribune reported PTI leaders as saying that Shahrez was arrested on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. They said that the arrest was made after a group of unidentified individuals entered forcibly entered the house. They said that the household staff were assaulted, family members were harassed, and Shahrez was taken away from his bedroom in front of his children. After his ouster in 2022 in a trust vote, Imran fell out of the favour with the army. He accused the Army of conspiring with the then-Opposition parties and the United States to bring his government down. Since fall fallout, Imran and his family have since been slapped with dozens of cases. He has more than 100 cases against him and has been in jail continuously for more than two years. Shahrez is an Oxford University graduate and works as the regional head at Simba Global, a big linen supplier based in Australia and is also a triathlete, according to Dawn. Erika Kirk delivered an emotional speech from her late husband's studio, addressing President Trump directly. She urged people to join a church and keep Charlie Kirk's mission alive, despite technical interruptions. Erika vowed to continue Charlie's campus tours and podcast, promising his mission will not end. is on YouTube Copyright @ 2024. Firstpost - All Rights Reserved",

        "raw_text": "मेगास्टारचिरंजीवीने तेलुगु फिल्म इंडस्ट्री में कलाकारों और तकनीशियनों की बढ़ती फीस के जटिल मुद्दे में हस्तक्षेप करने और समाधान निकालने के लिए तेलंगाना के मुख्यमंत्री रेवंत रेड्डी का दिल से धन्यवाद किया है। अपने एक्स टाइमलाइन पर चिरंजीवी ने तेलंगाना के मुख्यमंत्री रेवंत रेड्डी का तहे दिल से धन्यवाद किया। उन्होंने लिखा कि मुख्यमंत्री ने फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के एक बेहद जटिल मुद्दे को बेहद संतुलित और समझदारी से सुलझाया, जिससे प्रोड्यूसर्स और वर्कर्स दोनों के साथ न्याय हुआ। वरिष्ठ तेलुगु अभिनेता ने कहा कि तेलुगु फिल्म उद्योग के विकास के लिए मुख्यमंत्री द्वारा उठाए गए कदम काबिल-ए-तारीफ हैं। उन्होंने यह भी कहा कि हैदराबाद को सिर्फ भारत ही नहीं, बल्कि पूरी दुनिया के फिल्म उद्योग का केंद्र बनाने के मुख्यमंत्री के प्रयास सचमुच सराहनीय हैं। अभिनेता ने उम्मीद जताई कि तेलुगु फिल्म उद्योग इसी तरह एकजुट होकर आगे बढ़ता रहेगा और सरकार भी हर संभव सहयोग देती रहेगी। Also Read :पाकिस्तान में मूसलाधार बारिश का कहर, अब तक 657 लोगों की मौत गौरतलब है कि तेलुगु फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के कर्मचारी संघ ने 4 अगस्त से हड़ताल का ऐलान किया था। यह हड़ताल इसलिए की गई क्योंकि फिल्म श्रमिकों की 30 फीसद वेतन बढ़ाने की मांग को तेलुगु फिल्म चैंबर ऑफ कॉमर्स ने ठुकरा दिया था। हड़ताल की घोषणा के चलते शूटिंग और फिल्म से जुड़ी सभी गतिविधियां ठप हो गई थीं। दोनों पक्ष अपनी-अपनी बात पर अड़े रहे, जिससे लंबे समय तक कोई हल निकलता नहीं दिख रहा था। लेकिन आखिरकार, दोनों पक्ष बातचीत के लिए तैयार हुए और गुरुवार को एक समाधान निकल आया। इसके बाद हड़ताल वापस ले ली गई। हड़ताल खत्म करने का फैसला तेलुगु फिल्म चैंबर ऑफ कॉमर्स और तेलुगु फिल्म इंडस्ट्री कर्मचारी संघों के प्रतिनिधियों ने लिया। यह निर्णय तेलंगाना राज्य फिल्म विकास निगम के अध्यक्ष दिल राजू और अतिरिक्त श्रम आयुक्त गंगाधर एस्लावथ की मौजूदगी में हुई एक संयुक्त प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में लिया गया। Pic Credit : ANI Naya India, A Hindi newspaper in India, was first printed on 16th May 2010.

WORLD Recently, Pakistani Army Chief General Asim Munir compared India to a luxury car and his own country to a dump truck, inviting widespread trolling and mockery online. Here's how Defence Minister Rajnath Singh responded to Munir's bizarre comments. Meemansa Shekhawat Updated :Aug 22, 2025, 06:06 PM IST Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday, i.e., August 22, took a jibe at Pakistani Army Chief Field Marshall GeneralAsim Munirfollowing his bizarre attempt to compare India with a luxury car and his own country with a dump truck, stating the remark itself highlightedPakistan'sfailure. “Everyone said that if two countries gained independence at the same time, and one country, through hard work, sound policies, and foresight, built an economy like a Ferrari, while the other is still in the state of a dumper, then it is their own failure. I also see this statement by Asim Munir as a confession,” Rajnath Singh said at anEconomic Timesevent. Earlier this month, Asim Munir, while speaking at an event in Florida, had said, “India is shining Mercedes coming on a highway like Ferrari [sic], but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?” However, his comments did not sit well with many who found them \"amusing\". Many users highlighted that Munir's statement presented his own country in a bad light and amounted to a blunt admission of India’s progress outpacing Pakistan’s. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also pointed out to Pakistan's \"robber mentality\", saying, “The Chief of the Pakistan Army, knowingly or unknowingly, has pointed towards a robber mentality, which Pakistan has been a victim of since its birth...We must break this delusion of the Pakistani Army\".

        "description": "Pakistan : Imran Khan nephews arrested , sent to police remand over May 9 riots",
        "raw_text": "Islamabad, Aug 22 (IANS) Lahore Police on Friday said that another nephew of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested from his residence, a day after his brother was taken into custody for his involvement in the May 9 protests. Pakistan's leading daily Dawn reported that a senior Lahore Police officer has confirmed the arrest of Shershah Khan, son of Imran Khan's sister Aleema Khan, who was arrested in connection with May 9 riots after Thursday's arrest of his brother Shahrez Khan. In a post on X, Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party termed the incident as an \"abduction\" and stated that the \"the rule of law has been replaced with the law of the jungle.\" The arrest comes a day after PTI stated that men dressed in plainclothes had \"abducted\" Aleema Khan's son from her residence. Later, Lahore police confirmed that Shahrez was arrested in a case related to the May 9 riots. Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Lahore on Friday sent Shahrez Khan on an eight-day physical remand in connection with the May 9 Jinnah House attack case. Earlier, the court had reserved its verdict on a police plea requesting 30-day remand of Shahrez, Pakistan-based Geo News reported. ATC Judge Manzar Ali Gul announced the decision after hearing arguments from both sides. During the court proceedings, Advocate Salman Akram Raja, who represented Shahrez Khan, stated that his client had been arrested two years after the Jinnah House attack. He argued that Shahrez Khan's mother, Aleema Khan, had already been discharged from the same case and requested the court to release his client. Raja asked the police about the evidence they had against his client, arguing that Shahrez Khan had no connection with political affairs of PTI and requested the court to drop charges against his client. However, police opposed the request, saying that Shahrez Khan had involvement in the Jinnah House attack in Lahore. Aleema Khan also took to social media and wrote on X, \"Last night, several plainclothes armed men stormed my residence in Lahore. They brutally assaulted our staff, harassed my daughter-in-law, and forcibly took away my son, Shahrez Khan, in front of his two young daughters. For over three years, this fascist regime in Pakistan has unleashed a reign of terror, raiding thousands of homes, abducting and harassing countless innocent civilians. Yet, despite their brutality, they have failed to break Imran Khan. \"Our children understand that the struggle Imran Khan is leading is far greater than any one of us. He has set a remarkable standard of resilience against tyranny. These cowardly actions only expose the fear and desperation of the oppressors. We place our trust in Allah alone, seeking His protection and justice,\" she added. Following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023, PTI supporters held violent protests in Pakistan, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also targeting the Lahore Corps Commander's residence. After the protests, police arrested thousands of protesters, including PTI leaders. --IANS akl/as IANS India Private LimitedA-6, Ground Floor, Block ASector-16, Noida, Uttar PradeshPhone:+91-120-4822400, 4822415, 4822416Email:,",

        "raw_text": "MUZAFFARABAD: The ongoing monsoon season has caused unprecedented damage across Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with at least 22 lives lost, 28 people injured, and over 800 houses damaged, according to Chaudhry Fareed, Secretary of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). Fareed said the Muzaffarabad Division has been hit the hardest, followed by Poonch and Kotli in the Mirpur Division. “Infrastructure damage includes 26 powerhouses, 33 bridges, 200 kilometers of roads under local government control, and nearly 100 kilometers of roads under the Communication and Works Department. Additionally, four schools, several health facilities, 40 irrigation channels, and 59 water supply schemes have been affected. The estimated financial loss stands at Rs. 8 billion,” he added. Fareed also said that the disaster response has involved some of the largest rescue operations in AJK’s history. At Ghalti Kully, 700 stranded people were successfully rescued, fed, and provided with travel arrangements. He confirmed that no bodies remain missing, and all deceased have been recovered. “This was a massive operation. Countless people were rescued from dangerous areas under extreme conditions,” he said. Among the most tragic incidents, he noted, was in Tehsil Naseerabad, where six members of a single family—including mother, father, and four children—died. In Taobutt (Neelum Valley), a mother and father from Karachi were killed in a jeep accident, while their young daughter was rescued and safely returned to her family. In Rawalakot, a women professor with a PhD from the USA, who was part of the local faculty, also lost her life. Fareed also reported widespread damage to forests, and said the Noseri Dam was filled to capacity. A large amount of timber—both uprooted and cut—flowed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir via the Neelum and Jhelum rivers. A serious public safety threat has emerged along the Line of Control (LoC), where landmines and explosive materials planted for security have been washed downstream. “Explosive remnants, including missile fragments, have surfaced in various areas. We’ve launched a media awareness campaign to inform the public and prevent further casualties,” Fareed said. He added that under the government’s relief framework, families affected by the disaster are receiving financial aid, temporary shelter, food supplies, kitchen utensils, and medical kits. Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority, warned that Pakistan-administered Kashmir is currently experiencing its seventh monsoon spell, expected to continue until August 22 or 23. He said additional eighth and tenth spells are forecast from August 23–30 and September 1–10, and these may be even more intense than previous ones. “Initially, we estimated rainfall would be 20–25% above normal,” Khan said. “But now, updated assessments show a 70–75% increase. Some of this has already occurred, but more is expected.” He warned the region may face a worse situation next year, with 11–12 monsoon spells likely in 2026, and even greater intensity. A key issue, he noted, is the localized nature of rainfall: “This year’s damage is largely due to cloudbursts in specific areas, which cause sudden flooding in streams. Widespread rain usually causes less damage, but localized events have been far more destructive,” he said. “We are dealing with the most severe monsoon impacts in recent memory. If the current trends continue, disaster preparedness in Pakistan-administered Kashmir will need to scale up drastically,” Khan emphasized. Have you liked the news article?

        "raw_text": "पाकिस्तान के हवाई अड्डों और आतंकवादी मुख्यालयों पर सफल हमले के बाद भारतीय वायुसेना (IAF) ने इजरायल से रैम्पेज मिसाइलों की बड़ी संख्या में खरीद के लिए ऑर्डर देने की प्रक्रिया शुरू कर दी है। ये हवा से जमीन पर मार करने वाली मिसाइले हैं। बता दें कि रैम्पेज मिसाइलों को भारतीय वायुसेना में हाई स्पीड लो ड्रैग-मार्क 2 मिसाइल के नाम से जाना जाता है। इनको पहले से ही सुखोई-30 एमकेआई, जगुआर और मिग-29 लड़ाकू विमान बेड़े के साथ जोड़ा जा चुका है। रक्षा सूत्रों ने समाचार एजेंसी एएनआई को बताया कि ये मिसाइलें आपातकालीन खरीद प्रक्रिया (फास्ट ट्रैक प्रोसीजर) के तहत बड़ी संख्या में खरीदी जा रही हैं और जल्द ही ऑर्डर देने की संभावना है। रैम्पेज मिसाइलों का उपयोग हाल ही में ऑपरेशन सिंदूर के दौरान किया गया था। इनका इस्तेमाल सुखोई-30 एमकेआई विमानों से पाकिस्तान के पंजाब प्रांत में मुरिदके और बहावलपुर में स्थित आतंकवादी मुख्यालयों को अत्यंत सटीकता के साथ नष्ट करने के लिए किया गया। रैम्पेज एक हाई-स्पीड हवा से जमीन पर मार करने वाली मिसाइल है, जिसे भारत ने पहली बार 2020-21 में गलवान घाटी में चीन के साथ संघर्ष के दौरान खरीदा था। ऑपरेशन सिंदूर के दौरान इस मिसाइल ने पाकिस्तानी क्षेत्रों में बहुत अंदर तक लक्ष्यों को भेदने में शानदार प्रदर्शन किया। सूत्रों ने बताया कि भारतीय वायुसेना अब उन सभी विमान बेड़ों के लिए रैम्पेज मिसाइलों के ऑर्डर दे रही है, जिनके साथ इसे पहले से इंटीग्रेट किया गया है। इसके साथ ही, वायुसेना अन्य विमान बेड़ों में भी इस मिसाइल को शामिल करने की संभावनाओं की तलाश कर रही है। रैम्पेज मिसाइलों का सुखोई-30 एमकेआई के साथ सफल एकीकरण ने रूसी मूल के इस विमान बेड़े की मारक क्षमता को काफी हद तक बढ़ा दिया है। यह एकीकरण वायुसेना को कई लंबी दूरी की हवा से जमीन पर मार करने वाली मिसाइलों, जैसे कि 400 किलोमीटर से अधिक की मारक क्षमता वाली ब्रह्मोस सुपरसोनिक मिसाइल को उपयोग करने की क्षमता प्रदान करता है। इसके अलावा, भारतीय वायुसेना मेक इन इंडिया कार्यक्रम के तहत रैम्पेज मिसाइलों के स्वदेशी उत्पादन की संभावनाओं पर भी विचार कर रही है, जिससे इन मिसाइलों को बड़े पैमाने पर शामिल किया जा सके। रैम्पेज मिसाइलों के अलावा, भारतीय वायुसेना ने पिछले साल अंडमान और निकोबार द्वीप समूह में रॉक्स (क्रिस्टल मेज-2) मिसाइल का सफल परीक्षण किया था। यह कदम वायुसेना की बढ़ती सामरिक ताकत और आधुनिक हथियारों को अपनाने की प्रतिबद्धता को दर्शाता है। रक्षा सूत्रों का कहना है कि रैम्पेज मिसाइलों की खरीद और उनके संभावित स्वदेशी उत्पादन से भारतीय वायुसेना की युद्धक क्षमता में और इजाफा होगा, जिससे यह क्षेत्रीय सुरक्षा चुनौतियों का सामना करने के लिए और अधिक सक्षम होगी। आरएसएसविज्ञापन र॓टहमार॓ साथ काम करेंहमारे बारे मेंसंपर्क करेंगोपनीयतासाइट जानकारी Advertise with usAbout usCareersPrivacyContact usSitemapCode Of Ethics Partner sites:Hindustan TimesMintHT TechShineHT TeluguHT BanglaHT TamilHT MarathiHT AutoHealthshotsHT SmartcastFAB Play",

        "raw_text": "Subscribe Now! Get features like Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Friday terminated the services of two government employees in Kupwara district for terror links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba. The employees whose services were terminated are Siyad Ahmad Khan of Keran, who worked as an assistant stock man in the sheep husbandry department, and Khurshid Ahmad Rather of Nawah Gabra Karnah in Kupwara. Both were arrested in Kupwara last year for their links with the terror outfits. Law-enforcement agencies of the Union Territory and the lieutenant governor invoked Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution, which allows dismissal without an inquiry “in the interest of national security”. This is the fourth termination of government employees since Omar Abdullah took over as the chief minister in October last year. Since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, the J&K government has terminated the services of 77 government employees for having links with separatists and terror organisations. Opposition political parties and ruling National Conference leaders have termed these terminations as vendetta against local residents. Siyad Ahmad Khan was employed in the sheep husbandry department in 2024, an official said, adding that he was assigned to receive an infiltrating group from Pakistan and sheltering them. “He was intercepted and arrested on January 24 last year at the Peerbaba shrine in Keran by a joint team of the police and the army. An AK assault rifle was recovered from him, which he was carrying for a terrorist. Arms and ammunition were also recovered from his accomplice Rafaqat Ahmad,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Khurshid Ahmad was appointed as a Rehbar-e-Taleem (ReT) in the education department in 2003 and officials said he was actively working as an LeT conduit and was arrested last year along with weapons. Sources in the government said that Khurshid was working as an overground LeT worker. “He (Khurshid) became an active conduit for terrorist activities of the LeT and investigations revealed that he was given an assignment to procure arms, ammunition and narcotics by LeT handlers based in Pakistan for further distribution among terrorists operating in the Valley,” the official said. He said that Khurshid was in touch with Pakistan-based handlers Manzoor Ahmed Sheikh, alias Shakoor, and Javid Ahmed. “Investigations revealed that he had received several consignments containing weapons and narcotics through the Line of Control at Karnah. The weapons were supplied to active terrorists, while the proceeds from the narcotic sale were used to fund terror operations. His role was exposed after law-enforcement agencies received an input in January 2024 that two Pakistani terrorists were involved in smuggling arms with the help of four accomplices in Kupwara. The four, namely Khurshid Ahmad Rather, Zahoor Ahmed, Ghulam Sarwar and Qazi Fazal, were picked up and during questioning, the network got exposed. A case was registered and Khurshid was arrested,” the source said. A cache of arms and ammunition, including five AK type (short) MP 5 rifles, an AK-47 rifle, two pistols, five MP 5 magazines, two pistol magazines, an AK-47 magazine and 20 AK-47 rounds were recovered from them. In June this year, lieutenant governor Sinha had sacked three government employees, including a police constable, for their terror links. On November 30 last year, he terminated the services of two government officials for their involvement in anti-national activities and terror links.",

The Bengal Files : ‘द बंगाल फाइल्स’ निर्माता- निर्देशक विवेक अग्निहोत्री की यह फिल्म 5 सितंबर को सिनेमा घरों में रिलीज होगी, लेकिन रिलीज से पहले ही यह फिल्म विवादों में गई है. यह फिल्म आजादी से पहले बंगाल में हुए सांप्रदायिक हिंसा पर आधारित है. फिल्म में मुस्लिग लीग के डायरेक्ट एक्शन डे को भी दर्शाया गया है. फिल्म में एक किरदार है गोपाल मुखर्जी का, जिन्हें फिल्म में हिंदुओं के संरक्षक के रूप में दिखाया गया है, लेकिन गोपाल मुखर्जी के पोते शांतनु मुखर्जी फिल्म के ट्रेलर को देखकर यह आपत्ति जता रहे हैं कि उनके दादा जी के चरित्र को फिल्म में गलत तरीके से प्रस्तुत किया गया है. द बंगाल फाइल्स का ट्रेलर 16 अगस्त को रिलीज किया गया है. उसके बाद से ही इस फिल्म को लेकर विवाद शुरू गया है. फिल्म के एक किरदार गोपाल मुखर्जी, जिन्हें गोपाल पाठा के रूप में मूवी में चित्रित किया है, उनके पोते सामने आकर यह कह रहे हैं कि उनके दादा जी को फिल्म में गलत तरीके से प्रस्तुत किया गया है. शांतनु मुखर्जी ने इस बारे में पुलिस में शिकायत दर्ज कराई है, उनकी शिकायत की वजह से फिल्म का ट्रेलर रिलीज करने में परेशानी आई और बाद में एक होटल में इसे रिलीज किया गया. शांतनु मुखर्जी का कहना कि मेरे दादा जी जरूरमंदों की मदद करते थे उनका चरित्र उस तरह का नहीं है जैसा फिल्म में दिखाया गया है. शांतनु मुखर्जी ने आरोप लगाया कि मेरे दादा जी का चित्रण करने से पहले हमेशा कोई बातचीत भी नहीं की गई है. वहीं कई राजनीतिक दलों ने इसे राजनीतिक प्रचार बताया है, जो राजनीतिक फायदे के लिए किया गया है. गोपाल मुखर्जी को द बंगाल फाइल्स में हिंदुओं के संरक्षक और मुसलमानों के विरोधी के रूप में दिखाया गया है. इसपर उनके पोते ने आपत्ति की है. गोपाल मुखर्जी का एक आॅडियो इंटरव्यू 1997 में बीबीसी के रिपोर्टर एंड्रयू व्हाइटहेड ने लिया था, जिसमें वे स्पष्ट तौर पर यह कहते हैं कि वे यह नहीं चाहते थे कोलकाता में दंगा फैले, लेकिन उनके लाख प्रयासों के बावजूद हिंसा हुई. हिंसा के पहले और दूसरे दिन मैंने सबको रोकने की कोशिश की. मैंने अपने मुसलमान दोस्तों से भी यह कहा कि हम भाई-भाई की तरह रहते हैं और वैसे ही रहेंगे, हिंसा ठीक नहीं है, लेकिन जब मेरी बात नहीं मानी गई और लड़ के लेंगे पाकिस्तान का स्लोगन गूंजने लगा तो मैंने अपने लड़कों को भी तैयार रहने को कहा और उन्हें यह स्पष्ट कर दिया कि अगर वे हमारे एक लोगों को मारेंगे तो हम उनके 10 लोगों को मारेंगे. इस इंटरव्यू में वे यह स्वीकार करते हैं कि उनकी भूमिका दंगे में थी उनके लोगों ने कितने लोगों को मारा था इस प्रश्न पर वे कहते हैं कि हमारे पास कोई लिस्ट थोड़े ना है, पर हमने मारे थे. गोपाल चंद्र मुखर्जी की उम्र 1997 में 83 साल थी. उनकी कोलकाता में मीट की दुकान थी, जिसकी वजह उन्हें पाथा या पाठा कहा जाता था. गोपाल चंद्र मुखर्जी की भूमिका दंगा में क्या थी इसके बारे में उनके इंटरव्यू के अलावा एक किताब में भी बताया गया है. इंडियन एक्सप्रेस ने अपनी रिपोर्ट में लिखा है कि गोपाल चंद्र मुखर्जी के बारे में जो भी पुष्ट जानकारी है, वो यह इंटरव्यू और 1996 में प्रकाशित ‘कलकत्ता अंडरवर्ल्ड’ किताब है. गोपाल मुखर्जी ने अपने इंटरव्यू में यह भी स्वीकार किया है कि जब हिंसा के बाद लोग अपने हथियारों को गांधी जी के पास जमा करा रहे थे, मैंने ऐसा नहीं किया. इसकी वजह यह थी कि मैं उन हथियारों को अपने पास रखना चाहता था, जिससे मैंने अपनी बहू-बेटियों की रक्षा की थी. वे यह भी बताते हैं कि मैंने अपने लड़कों से यह कहा था कि वे दंगाइयों के अलावा किसी को निशाना ना बनाएं और ना ही महिलाओं के साथ कोई गलत हरकत करें. पाकिस्तान के लिए मुस्लिम लीग ने की थी डायरेक्ट एक्शन की घोषणा, कलकत्ता में हुआ था भीषण दंगा अंग्रेजों ने कैबिनेट मिशन प्लान के तहत जब भारत को एक संघ के रूप में आजाद करने का मन बनाया तो मुस्लिम लीग को ऐसा लगा उनकी पाकिस्तान की मांग कहीं दबकर रह जाएगी, तब उन्होंने देश विभाजन की मांग को और भी तेज कर दिया. जिन्ना बार-बार यह कहने लगे कि हिंदू और मुसलमान दो आइडेंटिटी हैं और वे एक साथ नहीं रह सकते हैं. कांग्रेस जब विभाजन की मांग पर सहमत नहीं हो रही थी और गांधीजी देश विभाजन का पुरजोर विरोध कर रहे थे, तब मुस्लिम लीग ने डायरेक्ट एक्शन डे की घोषणा की और मुसलमानों को यह कहा कि वे खुद सड़क पर उतरें और पाकिस्तान की मांग करें. 16 अगस्त 1946 को डायरेक्ट एक्शन डे के रूप में मनाने का फैसला हुआ. मुसलमान सड़क पर उतरे, जिसके बाद कलकत्ता में भयंकर दंगे हुए जिसमें 10 हजार से ज्यादा लोग मारे गए, इस घटना को ग्रेट कलकत्ता किलिंग कहा जाता है. यह हिंसा चार दिनों तक चली थी उसके बाद इसका विस्तार देश के दूसरे राज्यों में भी हो गया और इसे देश के विभाजन के लिए जिम्मेदार कारणों में से एक माना जाता है. ये भी पढ़ें :High Tide : भारी बारिश के बीच हाई टाइड का अलर्ट कितना है खतरनाक? जानें इनके बीच क्या है संबंध उत्तराखंड में खीरगंगा नदी ने लाई तबाही, जानिए बादल फटने पर कितने मिमी होती है बारिश?

        "raw_text": "SOURCE: IANS Former Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan, in an exclusive interview with IANS, made explosive claims that Pakistan’s powerful spy agency, the ISI, is regrouping Lashkar-e-Taiba and other militant outfits under the ISIS (K) banner to utilise as a proxy force in both Balochistan and Afghanistan. On Kashmir, Ehsan, speaking from an undisclosed location, said that Pakistan won’t end the covert war in Kashmir but will avoid overt military operations. He warned that Islamabad’s strategy is shifting toward a “low-intensity insurgency,” mixing propaganda, proxies, and selective violence, while Pakistan’s military leadership tightens its embrace of Washington to balance China and keep Afghanistan within its orbit. Interview excerpts: IANS: We have seen the strengthening of strategic ties between Islamabad and Washington. Pakistan’s Army Chief Field Marshal Munir visited the U.S. twice in the last four months. Ehsanullah Ehsan: The recent revival of relations between Islamabad and Washington, along with visits by Pakistan’s military leadership, primarily aims to create a balance for Pakistan. The U.S. seeks to curb China’s growing influence in the region, while Pakistan, burdened by its deteriorating economy and mounting debts, feels compelled to secure Washington’s support. Since the real power in Pakistan lies with the military – while the political government functions merely as its puppet – it is evident that the role of the military leadership is to restructure strategic and defence cooperation so that Pakistan can once again align itself with the American agenda. To demonstrate loyalty to Washington, the military has in the past plunged its own country into an unending war, and it is now taking steps to reaffirm that loyalty once again. The U.S. needs Pakistan to maintain oversight on Afghanistan, while Pakistan requires American backing to sustain its fragile economy. Thus, both sides are currently moving forward based on this mutual dependence. IANS: President Trump has expressed his interest in resource-rich Balochistan. Now, the US has also designated BLA as a terror outfit. What does it mean for the Baloch liberation movement? Ehsanullah Ehsan: The U.S. designation of the BLA as a terrorist organisation appears to be an attempt to appease Pakistan, so that Washington can, in return, extract cooperation for its strategic interests. The U.S. has its eyes set on Balochistan’s natural resources and its geostrategic significance. While this decision will indeed increase diplomatic and financial pressure on the Baloch separatist movement, Washington can, at any moment in the future, choose to revive the “Baloch issue” under the banners of “human rights” or “self-determination,” depending on its interests. In my view, this designation is a temporary measure. The U.S. currently needs Pakistan and, for that reason, is trying to keep Islamabad satisfied. However, given that the Baloch struggle for independence is legitimate and has international recognition, it will be difficult for Washington to ignore it for long. IANS: In the past few years, the recruitment into LeT, Lashkar and Hizbul in Kashmir has come down. Where are these groups operating now? Ehsanullah Ehsan: The decline in local recruitment within Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen indicates that public support for these groups in Kashmir is diminishing, while New Delhi’s stringent security policies have weakened their networks. However, these groups have not been eliminated; rather, they are being reintroduced in new forms. For instance, Lashkar-e-Taiba is now being absorbed into ISIS-Khorasan and is being utilised as a proxy force in both Balochistan and Afghanistan. IANS: Do these groups work under the direct command of ISI, and what could be their new strategy for Kashmir? Ehsanullah Ehsan: It would be accurate to say that these groups operate entirely under the command of the ISI, as their policies are shaped by the agency, which provides them with funding, assigns targets, and forces them underground whenever necessary. The longstanding objective of Pakistan’s establishment has been to sustain a “low-intensity insurgency” in Kashmir. Under the new strategy, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on political fronts and social media propaganda to keep the Kashmir issue alive while avoiding direct international pressure. IANS: Will Pakistan, via its proxies, continue to create turbulence in Kashmir? If yes, what could be their strategy? Ehsanullah Ehsan: Pakistan will not completely end its interference in Kashmir through proxies, as this remains an integral part of its strategic policy. However, the new approach will likely shift from direct military operations toward “low-intensity” activities – smaller-scale attacks, political propaganda, and fueling public resentment among Kashmiris. Islamabad is well aware that overt military operations would intensify international pressure on Pakistan and provoke India into retaliation, potentially leading to direct conflict. For this reason, Pakistan will continue its proxy war in a more covert and limited manner. IANS: It is often said that ISIS and LeT are different groups with different schools of thought. How true is that? Ehsanullah Ehsan: There is a clear sectarian alignment between ISIS and Lashkar-e-Taiba, as both stem from the same Ahl-e-Hadith school of thought and are ideologically very close. At least 99 per cent of ISIS fighters come from this background. Lashkar-e-Taiba was nurtured within the framework of jihadist politics in the Indian subcontinent and has largely aligned its vision with Pakistan’s policies. ISIS, on the other hand, is a transnational group with a rigid “takfiri” ideology. Yet, Pakistani institutions have now brought the two together for their interests, enabling both to operate under the ISIS banner as proxies for Pakistan. In recent days, we have witnessed organisations under the ISIS title openly declaring attacks against those fighting for Balochistan’s independence – an explicit demonstration of how their actions are serving Pakistan’s strategic objectives. IANS: We are seeing the growing ties between New Delhi and Kabul. Although New Delhi has not officially recognised the Taliban regime, the ties are growing. Similarly, Islamabad and Kabul have upgraded full-fledged diplomatic ties. What is ISI thinking? Ehsanullah Ehsan: The warming of relations between New Delhi and Kabul poses a diplomatic challenge for Pakistan. Although India has not formally recognised the Taliban government, it is steadily expanding practical engagement to secure its influence in Afghanistan. Islamabad, on the other hand, seeks to keep the Taliban government within its orbit to preserve its so-called “strategic depth.” However, the Taliban’s independent foreign policy this time has complicated matters for Pakistan, leaving it largely unsuccessful in safeguarding its interests in Afghanistan. Should the Indian government seize this opportunity to strengthen its diplomatic ties with the Taliban, Afghanistan’s dependence on Pakistan will diminish – an outcome that would deal a serious setback to Islamabad.

        "raw_text": "Rajnath Singh addresses Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir's 'Mercedes vs. dump truck' analogy, calling it a 'confession' of Pakistan's economic failure Reacting to Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir's much-trolled claim that India is a shining Mercedes coming on a highway, while Pakistan is a dump truck full of gravel, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he considers this statement by the Pakistan Army chief a \"confession.\" Munir had made the remarks during his second visit to the US. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser, Munir had asked. Munir's analogy was intended to suggest that although India is seen as an economically and technologically advanced nation, if a collision occurred, the \"dump truck\" (Pakistan) could still inflict damage, citing the resilience and potential threat Pakistan poses—especially with its nuclear arsenal. Singh said he does not consider the statement by Munir as mere troll material. \"India's economy is like a Mercedes and a Ferrari running on the highway. He said, I am not saying. Pakistan's economy is like a dump truck full of debris. Now you people know the answer to this,\" Singh said. \"Now, Asim Munir was trolled a lot for this statement both inside Pakistan and all over the world. Everyone said if two countries got independence at the same time and one country built a Ferrari-like economy through hard work, right policies and foresight, and the other is still in a dumper state, then it is their own failure,\" the defence minister said. Singh added that he, however, considers this statement by Munir as a confession and not some troll material. If we do not pay attention to the historical indication behind this serious warning, then it can become a matter of concern for us, Singh said and added, \"And yes, if we pay attention to this and prepare for it, then India is capable of giving a befitting reply to such warnings.\" Join our WhatsApp Channelto get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp Nepal's bureaucracy grapples with devastated workspaces post-protests Nepal's bureaucracy grapples with devastated workspaces post-protests Asia Cup 2025: United Arab Emirates vs Oman - Muhammad Waseem beats Jos Buttler for world record; tops a list that also features Rohit Sharma and David Warner CRED launches Yosemite: A new financial ecosystem for India's affluent From Steam to stream: 5 games that demand a screen adaptation Legacy of MiG-21: India's enduring warrior of the skies How Bickram Ghosh, Taufiq Qureshi blended classical with contemporary music for ‘RamTa’ 'With simulators, we can rapidly train health care workers during pandemics or for new diseases': Kanika Chahal Equity surge *Articles appearing as INFOCUS/THE WEEK FOCUS are marketing initiatives Copyright © 2024 All rights reserved",

        "raw_text": "असम में एक आंकड़े के लिए शोध किया जा सकता है कि पिछले कुछ वर्षों में संविधान के अधिकार का इस्तेमाल करने के कारण थानों में कितने मुकदमें दर्ज कराए गए। ‘द वायर’ के संपादक सिद्धार्थ वरदराजन और इससे जुड़े पत्रकार करण थापर के खिलाफ नया मुकदमा तब दायर किया गया जब सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने पहले एक दर्ज मामले पर कार्रवाई करने पर रोक लगा दी थी। यह ‘राजनीतिक निशाने’ की प्रवृति की तरफ इशारा करता है। गत 11 जुलाई, 2025 को असम के मॉरिगांव में ‘द वायर’ के संस्थापक संपादक सिद्धार्थ वरदराजन के खिलाफ देशद्रोह के आरोप में एक एफआईआर (संख्या 0181/2025) दर्ज किया गया था। दरअसल, 28 जून, 2025 को ‘द वायर’ ने एक लेख प्रकाशित किया था जिसमे यह विश्लेषण शामिल था कि कश्मीर के पहलगाम में भारतीय नागरिकों के खिलाफ आतंकवादी हमले के बाद पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ किए गए आपरेशन सिंदूर में भारतीय वायु सेना को राजनीतिक नेतृत्व की बाधाओं के कारण लडाकू विमान गंवाने पड़े। सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने इस मामले में 12 अगस्त 2025 को 11 जुलाई, 2025 की एफआईआर पर कार्रवाई करने पर रोक लगा दिया। साथ ही भारतीय न्याय संहिता की धारा 152 में देशद्रोह को जिस तरह से प्रस्तुत किया गया है, उसके बारे में सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने सरकार को नोटिस जारी किया। सुप्रीम कोर्ट के 12 अगस्त 2025 के आदेश के बाद असम पुलिस की क्राइम ब्रांच ने 12 अगस्त, 2025 को ही सिद्धार्थ वरदराजन और करण थापर को सम्मन जारी किया, जिसमें उन्हें 22 अगस्त को गुवाहाटी के पान बाजार स्थित क्राइम ब्रांच कार्यालय में पेश होने के लिए कहा गया। लेकिन उन्हें एफआईआर की कोई कॉपी नहीं दी गई। हिन्दुस्तान टाइम्स में प्रकाशित एक खबर के अनुसार यह एफआईआर (संख्या 03/2025) गत 9 मई को दर्ज किया गया था, जिसमें ‘द वायर’ द्वारा प्रकाशित 14 आलेखों व साक्षात्कारों का उल्लेख किया गया। इस एफआईआर में भारतीय न्याय संहिता की धारा 152 यानी भारत की संप्रभुता, एकता और अखंडता को ख़तरे में डालने वाले कार्य, धारा 196 यानी विभिन्न समूहों के बीच दुश्मनी को बढ़ावा देना, धारा 197(1)(डी)/3(6), धारा 353, 45 और 61 के तहत आरोप लगाए गए हैं। खैर, दोनों मामलों में सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने 22 अगस्त, 2025 को सिद्धार्थ वरदराजन व करण थापर को गिरफ्तार करने से असम पुलिस को रोक दिया। हालांकि जस्टिस सूर्यकांत और जस्टिस जायमाल्या बागची ने दोनों से मामले के अनुसंधान में पुलिस को सहयोग करने को कहा है। कई थानों में एक तरह के आरोप में एफआईआर दर्ज कराने की घटनाएं राजनीतिक हथियार की तरह इस्तेमाल की जाती हैं। सत्ताधारी इसका इस्तेमाल करते हैं। सत्ता के संरक्षण में एफआईआर दर्ज करवाना और थानों में उसे दर्ज कर गिरफ्तारी व सम्मन जारी करना मुश्किल नहीं होता है। सत्ता संरक्षण इस तरह एफआईआर दर्ज करने व करवाने की संस्कृति से विरोधी या सत्ता से अलग विचार रखने वालों को वर्षों व महीनों परेशानियों और उत्पीड़न झेलने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ता है। अलग विचार रखने वाले सत्ता की ताकत के सामने घुटने टेक दें, यह सत्ता का उद्देश्य होता है। इसीलिए देखा जाता है कि वर्षों तक मुकदमा चलने के बाद कानून व नियमों की कसौटी पर आरोपी बरी हो जाते हैं। लेकिन सत्ता के संरक्षण में मुकदमें दर्ज कराने व करने वालों की कोई जवाबदेही सुनिश्चित नहीं है। असम में पत्रकारों के लिए सत्ता के मनमानेपन व विचारों के खिलाफ बोलना व लिखना बड़ी चुनौती होती है। बड़ी मीडिया कंपनियों में काम करने वाले पत्रकारों को एक तरह का सुरक्षा व संरक्षण होता है। लेकिन सोशल मीडिया व स्वतंत्र स्तर पर पत्रकारिता करने वालों के खिलाफ चौतरफा दमनात्मक माहौल रहता है। सहयोग की स्थितियां नदारद रहती है। असम में सोशल मीडिया पर लिखने वालों के खिलाफ बड़े पैमाने पर गिरफ्तारियां हुई हैं। राज्य सरकार ने सोशल मीडिया पर निगरानी के लिए टीम बनाई है। असम से बाहर के मीडिया संस्थानों व उनके लिए लिखने बोलने वाले पत्रकारों के खिलाफ देशद्रोह का आरोप लगाना मुश्किल नहीं होता, क्योंकि देशद्रोह तथ्यों पर आधारित नहीं होता है, बल्कि लिखी व बोली गई सामग्री की व्याख्या होती है। भारतीय दंड संहिता यानी ब्रिटिश राज में बने कानूनों में 124 (ए) के जरिए राजद्रोह के खिलाफ कानूनी कार्रवाई करने का प्रावधान किया गया। राज द्रोह के प्रावधनों को राष्ट्र द्रोह व देश द्रोह के रूप में 1947 में सत्ता परिवर्तन के बाद दुरुपयोग किया जाता रहा है। वर्ष 2021 में जब इस प्रावधान को सुप्रीम कोर्ट में चुनौती दी गई तब केवल उसी एक वर्ष में 124 (ए) के आरोप में देश भर में 76 मुकदमे दर्ज किए गए थे। मई, 2022 में सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने 124 (ए) पर रोक लगा दी। तब सरकार ने भारतीय दंड संहिता की जगह 2023 में भारतीय न्याय संहिता को लागू किया गया तो उसकी धारा 152 में 124 (ए) के मुकाबले राष्ट्रद्रोह के लिए कड़े प्रावधान शामिल किए। देश में मानवाधिकार और लोकतांत्रिक अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली संस्था पीयूडीआर ने 124 (ए) और 152 के प्रावधानों की तुलना की है और यह बताया कि नए प्रावधान से संविधान में बोलने की आजादी का प्रावधान किस कदर बाधित किया गया। ‘द वायर’ के खिलाफ इसका इस्तेमाल एक उदाहरण है। पत्रकारों के खिलाफ थाना दर थाना मुकदमे दर्ज करने व करवाने के मकसद बोलने व लिखने के संवैधानिक अधिकार का इस्तेमाल करने की चेतना पर हमला करना है। असम में इस प्रवृति का असर है। आमतौर पर यह माना जाता है कि जब पत्रकारों की अभिव्यक्ति की स्वतंत्रता को बाधित करने के राजनीतिक हथकंडे अपनाए जाते हैं तब पत्रकारिता से जुड़े लोगों के संगठन आवाज उठाते हैं। लेकिन असम से ‘द वायर’ के पत्रकारों के खिलाफ थाना दर थाना दर्ज मुकदमों को लेकर पत्रकार संगठनों की कोई प्रतिक्रिया अभी तक नहीं आई है। सोशल मीडिया में भी असम से प्रतिक्रियाओं का सन्नाटा दिखाई दे रहा है। यह किस हालात के संकेत हो सकते हैं? वर्ष 2026 में असम में विधानसभा के चुनाव होंगे। जैसे जैसे चुनाव के महीने नजदीक आते हैं, राजनीतिक पार्टियां अपने पक्ष में एक खास तरह का माहौल बनाने की कोशिश में लग जाती हैं। विपक्षी पार्टियां सत्ता की कार्रवाईयों व व्यवहार के खिलाफ लोगों को अपने पक्ष में करने की कोशिश करती हैं। लेकिन सत्ता को अपनी तमाम नाकामयाबियों को ढंकने वाले मुद्दों पर अपनी पूरी ताकत लगानी पड़ती है। माहौल को अपने पक्ष में बनाए रखने के लिए हर पल की सामग्री की जरूरत होती है। (संपादन : राजन/नवल/अनिल) फारवर्ड प्रेस वेब पोर्टल के अतिरिक्‍त बहुजन मुद्दों की पुस्‍तकों का प्रकाशक भी है। एफपी बुक्‍स के नाम से जारी होने वाली ये किताबें बहुजन (दलित, ओबीसी, आदिवासी, घुमंतु, पसमांदा समुदाय) तबकों के साहित्‍य, संस्‍क‍ृति व सामाजिक-राजनीति की व्‍यापक समस्‍याओं के साथ-साथ इसके सूक्ष्म पहलुओं को भी गहराई से उजागर करती हैं। एफपी बुक्‍स की सूची जानने अथवा किताबें मंगवाने के लिए संपर्क करें। मोबाइल : +, ईमेल : वरिष्‍ठ हिंदी पत्रकार अनिल चमडिया मीडिया के क्षेत्र में शोधरत हैं। संप्रति वे 'मास मीडिया' और 'जन मीडिया' नामक अंग्रेजी और हिंदी पत्रिकाओं के संपादक हैं",

        "description": "Pakistan Supreme Court approves former PM Imran Khan bail in eight May 9 cases",
        "raw_text": "Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, got some relief after the country’s Supreme Court approved the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s bail in eight May 9 cases. According to Pakistani news outletGeo News, the verdict was announced by a three-member bench — led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Yahya Afridi and comprising Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Muhammad Shafi. The justices were hearing the plea of PTI founder against the rejection of his bail by the Lahore High Court. In June this year, the high court dismissed the incarcerated prime minister’s bail petitions in separate cases related to the May 9 riots. The cases against Khan also include the attack on Jinnah House in Lahore. It is pertinent to note that the former Pakistani premier has been behind bars for over two years now. The PTI founder moved to the country’s Supreme Court against the LHC verdict, contending that the first information report (FIR) lacked sufficient evidence. The plea also termed the allegations of Khan’s involvement in the riots as baseless. According toGeo News,Khan’s plea states that he was in the NAB custody at the time of the riots, and hence he couldn’t take part in the ruckus that was happening across Pakistan. The plea also raises doubts over the case based on “contradictions” in the prosecution statements. The PTI founder’s appeal sought further investigation into the case, as he suspected mala fide intent on the part of the police for avoiding his arrest for five months and called the delayed police statements “unreliable”. During the hearing, the Pakistani chief justice Afridi asked prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi regarding the evidence against the suspect, to which the latter said that three witnesses had testified against Khan, coupled with the availability of a photogrammetric and voice matching test,Geo Newsreported. “WhatsApp messages are also available,” Naqvi said, adding that the trial court had approved carrying out various tests, but the suspect did not cooperate. “There will be legal repercussions [for this]. Why are you saying all that is only going in your favour?” CJP Afridi responded. Meanwhile, the politician’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, said that the challan is that the said eight cases had not been presented against Imran and the former prime minister was only named in three of the FIRs. Noting that if the SC gave an observation on the merits of the case, the trial would be affected by it, CJP Afridi announced the verbal verdict accepting the PTI founder’s bail petitions in eight May 9 cases,Geo Newsreported.

MORE BRIC was officially established in 2006 with its first meeting in New York attended by its four founding members: Brazil, Russia; India and China. Later in 2010 South Africa joined and it became BRICS. In 2024, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates also became BRICS Members. In 2025 Indonesia became a BRICS Member. BRICS also has ten countries as partners which could also become BRICS members. It is interesting to note that except India, all other countries have semi or full dictatorships. BRICS was primarily constituted for bringing non-European countries together with the goal of building economic relationships and forming a non dollar based group. With Trump’s threat, it is softening its stand on developing an alternative to the dollar. The last BRICS meeting was held on July 6-7. 2025 was a big circus which achieved nothing. Due to the fear of being arrested under international warrants, one of the founding members, Mr. Putin, participated over video. Another founding member Xi Ping of China did not attend as he correctly believed the meeting was a waste of time. In 2000, I was a delegate representing FICCI, at an international conference which was mainly attended by Asian, African and Caribbean Countries. This Conference was held in Jamaica. A large number of people attended. Like other international conferences, a number of delegations were mostly at their government expense. As I was a part of the business delegation, we all paid our own expenses. Most of the delegates were staying at expensive hotels on the beach. India’s Prime Minister Vajpayee stayed at a very expensive cabin and so did Chief Advisor Brijesh Mishra. Every day, there would be at least two sessions at which a lot of speeches were made. In the evening, there would be parties and of course a lot of drinking. At the July 6 BRICS Conference, India’s PM Narendra Modi and Brazil’s President Mr. Lula da Silva criticized the Western countries about the lack of their interest in issues facing the world and developing countries in particular, climate issues, economic disparity, health, poverty, unilateralism, and destruction of tropical forests, etc. There is a truth in these assertions, however, the leaders of almost all the developing countries including BRICS Members, after getting independence from the Western countries, continued to be dependent upon their former rulers and became power hungry and corrupt. Leaders and influential people from all of the BRICS countries including China have deposited billions of dollars in Swiss and other offshore banks. They do much less business among themselves than they do with the Western countries. A number of these countries like Russia, China, Iran and India spend billions on arms. Russia, China and Iran do it to satisfy their power hunger to consolidate their own power and subjugate other countries. India spends huge amounts to protect herself against China, one of the BRICS founding members and its ally Pakistan. Most of the African countries, under the influence of and bribed by the Western companies, sell the raw materials to the Western companies. Their business dealings among the BRICS Members have almost remained stationary. Brazil’s President Mr. Lula da Silva criticized the U.S. in particular and talked about peace and human rights. He completely ignored that almost all BRICS members openly support terror and wars. Three BRICS members, Russia, China, and Iran have been involved with mass murders. Human rights and peace are totally unknown and alien to most of the BRICS members. It is highly ironic that there was not even one word against Russia’s involvement in the mass killings of hundreds of thousands in Ukraine and a number of African Countries. Mr. Lula da Silva conveniently ignored the destruction of Amazon forests in his own countries. BRICS discussed adopting a non dollar currency. How can they have such a currency? As stated above, they do more business with the Western Countries than they do among themselves and they have stashed away huge amounts of dollars in Swiss and other offshore banks. If BRICS want to stay relevant and to have global impact and are serious in peace, BRICS should implement the following: It is understandable that most BRICS members, such as Russia, China and Iran will not take any of the above steps. It is better to look inward and not to blame others, otherwise BRICS meetings will continue having the annual big Tamasha without any real results. Views expressed above are the author's own.

        "raw_text": "Modi launches the blueprint for national resurgence emphasising self-reliance and wider global cooperation PR RameshPR Ramesh|22 Aug, 2025 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation on Independence Day, New Delhi, August 15, 2025 (Photo: Getty Images) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI’S REMARKSagainstaarthic swarth(economic selfishness) by the US in his Red Fort address on Independence Day cannot be seen in isolation. Modi’s words are closely tied to the agenda he has pursued since coming to power in 2014—driving growth and lifting millions out of poverty by creating conditions for entrepreneurship across socio-economic groups and genders, alongside judicious welfare measures. His confidence stems from the trust he commands among the masses, having improved both the ease of doing busi­ness and the ease of living for the majority of Indians. A closer scrutiny shows that he has achieved this by cutting the Gordian knot of past policies long entangled in ideology, inertia, expedi­ency, or a combination of all three. For naysayers and trenchant critics of Modi, the response came in the form of a recent upgrade by global ratings agency S&P which lifted India’s sovereign credit rating for the first time in nearly two decades, from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook. The move effectively invalidated US President Donald Trump’s preposterous claim that “India is a dead economy” and his expectation that his aggressive stance towards India would force New Delhi to cave. In fact, S&P also placed India “among the best-performing economies” for its 8.8 per cent real average GDP growth from FY22 to FY24, and noted that the country made huge strides despite global monetary uncertainty in a post-Covid world and the geopolitical shocks of wars in Ukraine and West Asia. The finance ministry was quick to describe S&P’s upgrade as recognition of India’s leader­ship, which it said had prioritised fiscal consolidation while sustaining a strong infrastruc­ture push and an inclusive growth agenda. It also pledged further reforms to achieve the long-term goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047. Trump, meanwhile, slapped a 50 per cent duty on Indian imports—half, he said, because India was “a very big abuser of tariffs”, and the other half in retaliation for its continued purchase of Russian crude oil. In that context, Modi’s defiant address on August 15 stood out from those of his predeces­sors. He placed self-reliance at the centre under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, urging the youth, scientists and government departments to develop indigenous technologies. The successes ofOperation Sindoorand the Make in India drive, he said, were evidence of the nation’s capacity. He also reaffirmed his commitment to protecting farmers, even as Wash­ington pressed Delhi to open its agricultural market. The EU and Australia are new avenues where India is already engaged in talks, with an FTA now signed with the UK. By pursuing South-South cooperation, India aims to position itself as a global supplier beyond the West, a reality that may disappoint those banking on headline diplomacy alone Among the new policy signals, Modi hinted at a major reform in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and announced the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana (PM-VBRY). With an outlay of ₹1 lakh crore, the scheme aims to generate 3.5 crore jobs for young people and rovide each with ₹15,000 on securing their first employment. That this was Modi’s 12th consecutive Independence Day speech—surpassing Indira Gandhi’s record of 11—was inci­dental. What mattered more was the message: Modi positioning himself as the leader who could decisively steer India away from the ghosts of the past no matter what the international pressures were. It is, therefore, not difficult to comprehend where he draws moral courage from to stand up to the world’s biggest economy and military power. BREAKING THE HABIT The achievements on Modi’s watch are for all to see as hehooked public-sector as well as corporate players to the growth bandwagon, in sharp contrast to earlier Indian leaders who had tapped national enterprise with great reluctance. In just over a decade, Modi has steered India to becoming the world’s fourth-largest economy. International investors, from Wall Street giants to London brokers like Jefferies’ Christopher Wood, are excited about its growth prospects. His government’s resolve has brought India’s banking system to an all-time low in non-performing International investors, from Wall Street giants to London brokers like Jefferies’ Christopher Wood, are excited about its growth prospects. His government’s resolve has brought India’s banking system to an all-time low in non-performing assets (NPAs) while forex reserves have touched historic highs, signs of resilience few economies can match. Behind the numbers lies a transformation rooted in both as­piration and pragmatism. The Make in India push has reshaped sectors from defence manufacturing to information technology (IT), creating global champions while nurturing local enterprise. The country’s startup ecosystem, home to dozens of unicorns and creator economy ventures, stands as a symbol of innovation, while pharma exports, blue economy initiatives, and the solar al­liance leadership demonstrate India’s global footprint in critical 21st-century sectors. The Modi years have also been marked by structural reforms: sweeping GST cuts to spur consumption, a 12.75 per cent income tax exemption for the middle class, and an eight-year low in inflation, all creating room for ordinary Indians to dream bigger. At the grassroots, over 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty, while 80 crore citizens receive free rations, buying the country vital time to consolidate a neo-middle class. India’s development story today is visible not just on balance sheets but in infra corridors, modernised railroads, airports, and assured drinking water supply reaching millions. It is a coun­try in motion, paved roads leading to digital highways. Modi’s New India radiates soaring ambition. The project is no longer survival or stability; it is about becoming the centrepiece of the global growth story. INHERITANCE OF LOSS What he inherited was not an India that looked particularlyrosy, for obvious reasons. According to economist Kunal Sen, in an article published in May 2024, if one goes by economic growth figures, the Modi government’s performance has been impres­sive: “When Modi came to power in 2014, economic growth was sluggish. A series of high-profile corruption cases had led to a loss of investor confidence in the Indian economy. Even a limited war with Pakistan did not hurt the economy. On the contrary, the conflict spurred demand for Indian-made defence equipment, including missiles, and became an occasion to showcase India’s military prowess to the world, driving up global sales But between 2014 and 2022, India’s gross domestic prod­uct (GDP) per capita (a measure of income per head) rose from US$5,000 (£4,000) to over US$7,000—an increase of roughly 40% in eight years. These calculations use purchasing power parity, a way of comparing general purchasing power over time and between countries.” This July, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its forecast for India’s economic growth to 6.4 per cent for both 2025 and 2026. Earlier, in its April 2025 World Economic Outlook, IMF had projected GDP growth at 6.2 per cent for 2025 and 6.3 per cent for 2026. The upward revision was attributed to a more benign external environment than anticipated. By comparison, China is forecast to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2025 and 4.2 per cent in 2026, while the US is expected to expand by 1.9 per cent in 2025 and 2 per cent in 2026. Even a limited war with Pakistan did not hurt the economy. On the contrary, the conflict spurred demand for Indian-made defence equipment, including missiles, and became an occa­sion to showcase India’s military prowess to the world—driving up global sales.Openhad reported earlier that stocks of Indian defence companies listed on the markets have seen marked growth thanks toOperation Sindoor. The company ideaForge Technology, which provided surveillance drones to the Army, saw its share prices soar. Paras Defence & Space Technologies, which supplied both surveillance and kamikaze drones, also saw significant gains. Other companies that performed strongly on the market include Solar Industries India Limited (developer of the Nagastra 1R loitering munition, a night-capable drone tested in key regions) and Adani Enterprises (through its subsidiary Adani Defence & Aerospace, which deployed SkyStriker kami­kaze drones and anti-drone defences duringOperation Sindoor), among others. Other firms that attracted global attention included Tata Advanced Systems, Asteria, Raphe, and Adani Alpha Design— all offering a full suite of weaponry ranging from loitering munitions and surveillance UAVs to drone swarms and logistics support systems. The private sector now contributes about 21 per cent of overall defence production. Among public-sector undertakings (PSUs), major players include Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Electronics, BEL Optronic Devices, Bharat Dynamics, BEML, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Goa Shipyard, Hindustan Shipyard, Gliders India, Troop Comforts, Armoured Vehicles Nigam, Munitions India, Yantra India, Cochin Shipyard, and India Optel. In the private sector, key companies include the Adani Group, Reliance, Bharat Forge, Mahindra, Tata Group, L&T India, and Punj Lloyd. Interestingly, India’s defence exports range from arms, ammunition and fuses to complete weapons systems. Indian firms are exporting advanced platforms such as the BrahMos missile and the Dornier-228 aircraft. What also helped was the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework in 2016 and the introduction of GST in 2017 which replaced a maze of indirect taxes, ensuring greater economic inte­gration and tax reform. The upcoming GST reforms are expected to reduce the tax burden further. There has also been a tremendous infrastructure push over the last 11 years: from 14km of road construction per day in 2014 the figure now stands at over 34km per day, reflecting India’s rising prowess in infrastructural development. India also emerged as ‘Vishwamitra’—the pharmacy of the world during Covid—sup­plying medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and vaccines to several countries. This demonstrated the country’s capability and resilience as well as its resolve to weather any storm. UNTIRING EFFORTS Relentless in his pursuit, the prime minister has set anaudacious economic goal for 2047. Starting with Swachh Bharat in 2014 to Naya Bharat today, his priorities have shifted towards self-reliance, innovation, and citizen empowerment in 2025. Tariff threats from abroad, incidentally, are giving India the opportunity to look towards emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Africa offers vast opportunities in infrastruc­ture, agriculture, and energy collaboration. Economists argue that India’s Act East Policy will help expand exports in apparel and electronics. ASEAN nations, with dynamic consumer mar­kets, present opportunities for Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, and machinery. The UK, the European Union (EU), and Australia are new avenues where India is already engaged in talks, with a free trade agreement (FTA) now signed with the UK. By pursuing South- South cooperation, India aims to position itself as a global sup­plier beyond the West, a reality that may disappoint those bank­ing on headline diplomacy alone. India, meanwhile, has also announced ambitious plans in semiconductor manufacturing. The government has declared that the first indigenous semiconductor chip will be ready for production this year. Since the Union Cabinet approved the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), with a ₹76,000 crore outlay to boost fabrication, design, and manufacturing, five production units are currently under construction, signalling a significant milestone for domestic capability. According to the Centre, from 2023 to 2025, a total of 10 projects under ISM have been approved, with cumulative invest­ments of around ₹1.6 lakh crore across six states. India has already built centres for advanced 3-nanometer chip design in Noida and Bengaluru. The government has announced that India is moving from traditional silicon-based semiconductors to the latest silicon carbide–based technologies. India is also the world’s third-largest solar energy producer, having doubled its solar manufacturing capacity and achieved its COP26 renewable targets five years ahead of schedule. Renewables now power over 50 per cent of India’s total capacity. India had recognised the importance of semiconductors ear­lier than most others—even Taiwan. As early as 1983, it had set up the Semi-Conductor Laboratory in Mohali, though a fire later destroyed its main production pipeline. The country has gained on multiple fronts. For instance, its for­eign exchange reserves rose by $4.747 billion in the week ending August 8 to reach $693.618 billion, driven by gains in both foreign currency assets and gold holdings, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). LEGACIES UNRESOLVED From the pharma laboratories of Hyderabad to the fintechhubs of Bengaluru, from coastal blue economy projects to solar-powered villages, Modi’s India exudes an unrelenting drive. But the India of 1947 was vastly different, one shackled by a leader­ship that despised entrepreneurs and showed little interest in business. Priorities were misplaced. None other than iconic industrialist JRD Tata, the late chairman of the Tata Group, who enjoyed good relations with Jawaharlal Nehru, had spoken of misplaced priorities at the top when it came to industry and in tapping into what the economist John Maynard Keynes had called “animal spirits” to create growth and more opportunities. As with meeting Nehru to discuss what industry could do for the country, JRD Tata once said in an interview, “I tried. I admired him. He liked me. I would go and see him… I would try to bring the conversation to economics, nationalisation, bureaucracy, he was not only not interested but he wasn’t even willing to talk… he had invented a little trick… if we sat near each other and there was a window not too far… the moment I (said something) he would turn around and look out of the window and I got the mes­sage.” He also said, “[I]f Vallabh Bhai (Patel) would have become the prime minister of India, certainly the economic plan… there would have been a totally different situation than the one that exists today.” JRD Tata died in 1993. JRD Tata (Right) had spoken of misplaced priorities at the top when it came to industry and tapping into ‘animal spirits’ to create growth and more opportunities. Later in an interview, Tata said that Jawaharlal Nehru (Left) ‘was not only not interested but he wasn’t even willing to talk’ While Nehru was a socialist who followed the footsteps of Soviet policies, various economists worldwide had advised him to work towards generating growth to finance welfare programmes and to lift millions out of poverty. In his bookThe Nehru-Era Economic History and Thought & Their Lasting Impact, economist Arvind Panagariya, currently chancellor of Nalanda University, writes about the dominant thinking of the time that prevented clearer industrial policy: “In retrospect, the develop­ment strategy Nehru adopted had serious flaws. Before we turn to a systematic dissection of these flaws, a pertinent question is whether there is a plausible scenario under which India could have opted for an alternative strategy. The answer to this ques­tion is unequivocally negative.” He explains why: “Several foreign statisticians and economists visited India during the winter of 1954-55. They were predomi­nantly left-leaning and often admirers of the Soviet model. They naturally endorsed the development model underlying the Draft Plan-frame.” He also points out that PC Mahalanobis, the statisti­cian and scientist who was a member of the Planning Commis­sion and contributed prominently to free India’s five-year plans starting with the second, “fully shared Nehru’s enthusiasm for as­signing the public sector the key role in the development of heavy industries”. At that time, however, Panagariya writes, “econo­mists from the Bombay School of Economics had submitted as many as six out of thirty-three papers by the Panel of Economists. Three of these papers expressed clear and important differences with the Draft Plan-frame.” He also concludes that “the only clear and comprehensive critique of the Nehru Model in 1955 came from Milton Friedman. In a memorandum containing less than 5000 words, he pointed a finger at nearly every single flaw in the model. But, alas, at the time, the ideas of Friedman were yet to gain wide acceptance even within the United States. As such, the prospects of their acceptance in the India of the time, so heavily dominated by Nehru and his followers, were nil.” It must be remembered that Lenin himself had reminded his followers in a report, while pushing for the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921 to revive the Russian economy, that “Communists do not know how to run the economy and, in that respect, are inferior to the ordinary capitalist salesmen, who have received their training in big factories and big firms. But we refuse to admit this; in this field communist conceit—komchvanstvo, to use the great Russian language again—still persists. The whole point is that the responsible Communists, even the best of them, who are unquestionably honest and loyal, who in the old days suffered penal servitude and did not fear death, do not know how to trade, because they are not businessmen, they have not learnt to trade, do not want to learn and do not understand that they must start learning from the beginning.” Lenin’s follower Stalin discontinued the experiment to encourage entrepreneurs to rev up the economy. And Nehru followed that model. Political expediency came in the way of most prime ministers who succeeded Nehru, including Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, who were keen to please parties that championed socialism and treated the private sector as the enemy. PV Narasimha Rao, despite kick-starting reforms in a major way and globalising the Indian economy, also faced similar challenges. It was Atal Bihari Vajpayee who first started putting India back on the track towards faster growth thanks to his thrust on infrastructure development through public-private partnerships and in creating a situation for entrepreneurs to thrive. Then came the wasted years of the Manmohan Singh-led coalition—UPA I and UPA 2—that put reforms in cold storage, notwithstanding the favourable global situation when accessing capital was much easier. By the time Modi came to power in 2014, the world had already been through a major economic meltdown and the situation was getting tougher for corporations to avail loans from international banks. Regardless, Modi placed great emphasis on both growth-oriented policies and ensuring that people, especially the poor, had access to basic services. For example, through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), a flagship scheme launched to make clean cooking fuel such as LPG available to rural and de­prived households otherwise dependent on firewood and coal, he showed how growth and human development can go hand-in-hand. While industrialising fast, Modi also emphasised roads, railways, airports, water, housing, and sanitation. Alongside, he ensured that rural folk gained access to bank accounts and made transactions far less cumbersome through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system developed by the National Payments Cor­poration of India (NPCI) in 2016. Back then, several opposition leaders, including former Union Minister P Chidambaram, had questioned whether villagers would use UPI instead of cash for financial transactions. Much to their dismay, it has now become a reality and a model for the world, even in remote locations. DEMOCRATISING TECHNOLOGY A State Bank of India (SBI) report said recently that in termsof value, average daily UPI transactions rose from ₹75,743 crore in January 2025 to 8₹0,919 crore in July 2025. The momentum further accelerated in August (to date), with the average daily value touching ₹90,446 crore, according to the report. The UPI experiment is being closely studied by policymakers and academ­ics alike across the globe. Such programmes were followed by measures to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) flourish and to boost consumption. No segment of the economy was left untouched by Modi’s comprehensive schemes. This included, for example, the popularisation of khadi as well as homegrown products, all of which clicked. Alongside, the Modi government in 2016 introduced the In­solvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which has since played a crucial role in reshaping India’s insolvency framework, resolving issues of financially stressed companies that would have oth­erwise gone belly-up. Remarkably, Modi refused to rest on past laurels and expanded outreach to newer markets to grow India’s trade relationships. That he won high honours in 27 countries is seen as recognition of his statesmanship and the enthusiasm of those nations to expand ties with India. Going back to chipmaking and other technology-focused manufacturing, Modi decided to rebuild what had been lost, for instance, after the Mohali fire. Chris Miller, author ofChip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, had toldOpenearlier that in the semiconductor sweepstakes, he is bet­ting big on India. “I am bullish about India’s prospects in the field,” he had said. A closer look at Modi’s flagship programmes and priorities shows that he has had the disadvantage of correcting the mis­takes of the past, yet he remains untiring in placing India on the centrestage of global politics. His convictions have often been misunderstood as overconfidence, much to the disadvantage of those who underestimated him. He is not interested in the com­petition that some countries pursue to maintain their hegemony, but rather in growing together and coexisting. Modi’s Red Fort address, delivered at a time when India faces intimidating tactics from the powerful, stood as a testament to his wisdom and tenacity. “I am not saying we need to increase our strength to cut someone to size. We need to draw a longer line; only then will the world accept our strength,” the prime minister declared. Even for an orator as skilled as Modi, his governmental initiatives encapsulate the vision of a leader who acts on his own terms, meets challenges head-on, and lets his actions speak louder than his words. 1 Ramani Atkuri 2 S Prasannarajan 3 PR Ramesh 4 V Shoba 5 Lhendup G Bhutia Living with the silence of AuschwitzSabin Iqbal Her PlaybookDevika Arora Indians Pouring into Russia - What Lies BeneathAlan Moore Sign up to receive interesting long form stories of Politics, India, Around the world and many more.. © 2025 Open Media Network Pvt.

        "raw_text": "A historian’s answer to the demographic imbalance TCA RaghavanTCA Raghavan|22 Aug, 2025 (Illustration: Saurabh Singh) THIS BOOK IS a historian’s deep dive into modern India’s demographic evolution. This is a history with rich primary sources ever since the first Census was conducted in the country in 1872. So, we have a full picture of the past 150 years to discern India’s population growth and all the regional variations and nuances of it. The latter point interests Ravi K Mishra the most inDemography Representation Delimitation. This is not just an academic exercise, given the implications for highly topical and political questions such as the North-South demographic divide and its impact on future representation in Parliament and state Legislative Assemblies. This is a meaty and empirically dense work—its main conclusions are striking and question the prevalent conventional wisdom that the Southern states have managed their demographic growth better than the Northern states. Mishra’s analysis reveals that different parts of the country have different demographic histories and transitions. The population of the Southern states had high growth rates—well above the national average—till the 1960s. As a consequence, the Southern share in the population of the country was at its peak in 1971 after which growth rates started slowing down. The Northern states showed the opposite trend: in the period up to the 1960s its growth rates were low and therefore its share of the population was a smaller fraction than it had been in the 1870s. The political takeaway from these trends is of political representation. A freeze of Lok Sabha seats and composition in terms of state wise distribution was affected in 1976. The current debate is whether to unfreeze that composition considering the latest Census figures and both increase the size of Lok Sabha and also allow for changes in the distribution of seats on the basis of one person one vote. Given current population trends and levels this would mean an increase of representation from the North and a proportional or relative decrease in the share of the Southern states. “The distortion in the present scheme of political representation is quite pronounced…The south is highly overrepresented in Parliament; the east is marginally over represented; the west is considerably under represented and the north is highly under represented. The divide is not really north versus south; rather, it is south versus the rest.” In Mishra’s perspective the 1976 freeze led to an “anomaly in representation” since Northern states were comparatively disadvantaged in demographic terms as compared to the South. This in his view is the central issue rather than optical illusions that states are being penalised for more effective population and birth control policies. His overall country-wide conclusion also merits being quoted: “… the distortion in the present scheme of political representation is quite pronounced……..the south is highly overrepresented in Parliament; the east is marginally over represented; the west is considerably under represented and the north is highly underrepresented. Thus, the divide is not really north versus south; rather, it is south versus the rest.” The hallmark of a good history book is its capacity to address hitherto unposed questions. Mishra’s empirically detailed and analytically rigorous work certainly satisfies both these criteria. Also like any good history book it is simultaneously deeply revisionist. His conclusions will certainly be analysed in detail by demographers and will be much debated. Yet his analysis poses other fundamental questions. The most fundamental of these is how majorities and minorities should interface in a democracy. At one point Mishra refers to the “overwhelming demographic size of Hindi speaking north”—although he does not use the term majority that is what he is referring to. Perhaps there is also merit in seeing the representation/delimitation debate as a majority minority debate and thereafter deriving policy takeaways in the context of the fact that the real litmus test of the quality of a democracy is how its minorities are represented. This book is timely and provocative. 1 Ramani Atkuri 2 S Prasannarajan 3 PR Ramesh 4 V Shoba 5 Lhendup G Bhutia Living with the silence of AuschwitzSabin Iqbal Her PlaybookDevika Arora Indians Pouring into Russia - What Lies BeneathAlan Moore Sign up to receive interesting long form stories of Politics, India, Around the world and many more.. © 2025 Open Media Network Pvt.

        "raw_text": "The discovery of oil in Pakistan will worsen its dysfunction Rahul ShivshankarRahul Shivshankar|22 Aug, 2025 Pakistan army chief Asim Munir (Photo: Getty Images) WE HAVE IT on the authority of US President Donald Trump that our neighbour, Pakistan, is about to become very, very rich. Trump claims the country is sitting on a massive bed of black gold. And how does he know? Because Pakistan’s self-appointed Field Marshal Asim Munir told him so a few weeks ago. Trump further disclosed that Munir assured him Pakistan will award drilling contracts to American oil majors. The timing of Munir’s grand oil claim is fuelling debate in strategic and economic circles. Experts point out that unlike Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Venezuela, Pakistan has never been synonymous with oil exploration. On the contrary, it remains heavily dependent on energy imports. This imposes a crippling burden on its fragile economy. If oil were truly its salvation, one would expect Islamabad to have pursued this lifeline years ago. The reality, however, is grim: Pakistan’s hydrocarbon output has been dwindling, and its record on oil and gas exploration is not just patchy but downright uninspiring. While there have been sporadic reports of potential reserves over the years, these have remained inconclusive. But Trump clearly is not one of the sceptics. He has gone on record that “maybe” Pakistan will be “selling oil to India someday.” But let the truth not come in the way of an entertaining Trumpian romp. Let us suspend belief for a moment and ask the question: What if Pakistan were to really strike it big by discovering subterranean wells bursting with millions upon millions of barrels of oil? Would the discovery be the magic fix that pulls Pakistan back from the brink of terminal dysfunction? Rather than reforming taxation, governance, or industry, Islamabad would lean even more heavily on this primordial resource. Patronage politics would balloon, corruption would metastasise, and accountability would vanish Unlikely. Look around. Pakistan’s economic benefactors and cultural exemplars in the Gulf have been lucky to discover this elusive elixir that has powered much of the 20th century. But where has it got them? Yes, they are undeservedly rich but the Gulf nations are also a version of totalitarian slave states. Money has bought glitzy skylines, but each is also a living museum to cruelty. Several Arab states are thriving on the toil of a virtually indentured migrant labour living in pitiable conditions in numerous camps under the unwavering watch of a brutish state police. Women are no better off. The political system is closed; independent media is not even practised, let alone contemplated. In short, this oil-soaked authoritarianism has worked to entrench a privileged and self-perpetuating elite that enjoys little legitimacy. The comparison with Pakistan couldn’t be more striking. Without the oil jackpot, Pakistan mirrors these Arab states in its reliance on tribalistic patronage networks, authoritarian impulses, and the suppression of both pluralism and dissent. Instead of hydrocarbons, it could be said that Pakistan’s ‘resource’ has been geostrategic rent-seeking. Leveraging its location to extract aid and investment from key global players. Pakistan’s ruling elite is its army. Its stranglehold on every stream of activity— political, economic and even legislative— is total and unshakeable. To top it all, this military-dominated framework when allied to political Islam fuels an odious obscurantism, hatred and disrespect for civility within and without. Just like in the Arab world, Pakistan’s dependency on its geography, army and religion has bred entitlement and not reform. The discovery of oil will only exacerbate Pakistan’s dysfunction. Rather than reforming taxation, governance, or industry, Islamabad would lean even more heavily on this primordial resource. Patronage politics would balloon, corruption would metastasise, and accountability would vanish. Pakistan may find itself under attack from within as people might finally challenge the inequity. In all likelihood, petro-dollars will embolden the already dominant military to double down on not only repression at home but also cross-border adventurism. South Asia could plunge into a bubbling cauldron of antagonisms. Some that may even pose an existential threat to Pakistan itself. The discovery of oil may not be a lifeline for Pakistan but a curse. 1 Ramani Atkuri 2 S Prasannarajan 3 PR Ramesh 4 V Shoba 5 Lhendup G Bhutia Living with the silence of AuschwitzSabin Iqbal Her PlaybookDevika Arora Indians Pouring into Russia - What Lies BeneathAlan Moore Sign up to receive interesting long form stories of Politics, India, Around the world and many more.. © 2025 Open Media Network Pvt.

The country is already at the centre of a bitter civil war over Kashmir. The conflict could be exacerbated by the discovery of more nuclear weapons. The US and the West could both be forced to take action against Pakistan. The world over the discovery. The global oil market could be the biggest threat to Pakistan. Pakistan could be at risk of being engulfed in a war between two nuclear-powered states. The U.S. and India may be able to use the discovery to turn the tide against each other. The West could also use the oil to turn Pakistan into an arms dealer. The oil could also help to create a new global market for nuclear weapons and weapons. Pakistan is at the heart of a global arms race. The region is at risk from a new arms race between the U.N. and the U.,S. The United States. and China. The Middle East could be in a global war of arms against eachother. The future of the region is uncertain. The fate of the world’S oil reserves in the region could be decided by the outcome of a U.K.-Pakistan conflict.",

भारताशेजारील या देशाकडे कोणकोणती अत्याधुनिक क्षेपणास्त्रे आहेत? त्या संदर्भातील घेतलेला हा आढावा… चीन आपल्या ८० व्या वर्धापन दिनानिमित्त ही भव्य लष्करी परेड आयोजित करत आहे. चीनच्या इतिहासात या दिवसाला मोठे महत्त्व आहे. १९३१ मध्ये चीनवर हल्ला करणाऱ्या जपानी साम्राज्याच्या शरणागतीनंतरच दुसरे महायुद्ध संपले होते. या कार्यक्रमाला राष्ट्रपती शी जिनपिंग तियानानमेन स्क्वेअर येथे उपस्थित राहणार आहेत. रशियन राष्ट्राध्यक्ष व्लादिमीर पुतिन यांनादेखील कार्यक्रमाचे निमंत्रण पाठवण्यात आले आहे. १ सप्टेंबर रोजी शांघाय कोऑपरेशन ऑर्गनायझेशनची बैठक होणार आहे. या बैठकीला हजर असलेले इतर देशांतील नेतेही कार्यक्रमाला उपस्थित राहतील, अशी माहिती चिनी प्रसारमाध्यमांनी दिली आहे. २०१९ च्या राष्ट्रीय दिनाच्या लष्करी परेडमध्ये चीनने आंतरखंडीय बॅलिस्टिक क्षेपणास्त्र, हायपरसोनिक ग्लाइड व्हेईकलसह मध्यम-श्रेणी बॅलिस्टिक क्षेपणास्त्र आणि पहिले पाण्याखालील ड्रोन सादर केले होते. गेल्या आठवड्यात चिनी सैन्याने बीजिंगमध्ये सराव केला होता. यादरम्यान चीनच्या लष्करी ताकदीची झलक पाहायला मिळाली, ज्यामध्ये नवीन हायपरसोनिक क्षेपणास्त्रे व ड्रोनचा समावेश होता. तर इतर लष्करी सामग्री मोठ्या ताडपत्रीने झाकलेली होती. मेजर जनरल वू यांच्या माहितीनुसार- यंदाच्या परेडमध्ये चिनी सैन्यातील नवीन रणगाडे तसेच जमिनीवर, समुद्रात आणि हवेत वापरली जाणारी क्षेपणास्त्रांची झलक दाखवली जाणार आहे. आणखी वाचा :अमेरिकेचा भारताविरोधी डाव, पाकिस्तानशी वाढवली जवळीक; पण शेवट निराशेतच होणार? पीपल्स लिबरेशन आर्मीतील सेंट्रल थिएटर कमांडच्या परेड कमांड ऑफिसचे कार्यकारी उपसंचालक मेजर जनरल झू गुइझोंग यांनी अलीकडील एका पत्रकार परिषदेत सांगितले की- या परेडमध्ये १०,००० हून अधिक सैनिक आणि १०० पेक्षा अधिक विमाने सहभागी होतील. तसेच इतर १०० वेगवेगळ्या उपकरणांचा समावेश असेल. अलीकडेच ऑनलाइन प्रसारित झालेल्या काही फोटो आणि व्हिडीओंमधून चीनकडील काही अत्याधुनिक शस्त्रांची झलक पाहायला मिळाली आहे, ज्यामध्ये नवीन पिढीचे रणगाडे, पाण्याखालील आणि जमिनीवरील वाहनांचा समावेश होता. चीनच्या ३ सप्टेंबरच्या लष्करी परेडमध्ये ‘ईगल स्ट्राइक’ मालिकेतील नवीन क्षेपणास्त्रे सहभागी होण्याची शक्यता आहे. ही क्षेपणास्त्रे जहाजे किंवा विमानांमधून सहजपणे डागता येतात. चिनी सैन्याच्या सरावादरम्यान, ‘ईगल स्ट्राइक’ क्षेपणास्त्रांसह तीन हायपरसोनिक क्षेपणास्त्रे- ‘YJ-17’, ‘YJ-19’ आणि ‘YJ-20’ देखील दिसून आली. ‘न्यूजवीक’च्या वृत्तानुसार- ‘YJ-15’ एक सुपरसॉनिक क्षेपणास्त्र असून ते आवाजाच्या वेगापेक्षा अधिक म्हणजे सुमारे ७६८ मैल प्रतितास वेगाने उडते. तर YJ-17 आणि YJ-19 ही क्षेपणास्त्रे आवाजाच्या वेगाच्या पाच पटीने अधिक वेगाने उडण्यास सक्षम आहेत आणि उड्डाणादरम्यान ते आपली दिशाही बदलू शकतात, त्यामुळे त्यांना रोखणे अत्यंत कठीण मानले जाते. परेडच्या सरावादरम्यान चिनी सैन्यांकडे एक नवीन ‘ट्रान्सपोर्टर-इरेक्टर-लॉन्चर’ वाहन दिसले. ‘साउथ चायना मॉर्निंग पोस्ट’च्या वृत्तानुसार- ही एक नवीन आंतरखंडीय बॅलिस्टिक क्षेपणास्त्र प्रणाली आहे. चीनच्या लष्करी परेडमध्ये फक्त जमिनीवरील शस्त्रेच नव्हे, तर समुद्रातील अत्याधुनिक ड्रोन आणि नवीन पिढीचे रणगाडेदेखील सादर केले जाणार आहेत. ‘नेव्हल न्यूज’ या नौदल तंत्रज्ञानावर लक्ष केंद्रित करणाऱ्या प्रकाशन संस्थेनुसार- चिनी सैन्याच्या सरावादरम्यान त्यांच्याकडे सर्वात प्रगत रणगाडे, पाणबुड्या, सक्रिय संरक्षण प्रणाली, लेसर शस्त्र आणि हवाई संरक्षण तोफ यांसारखी शस्त्रास्त्रे दिसून आली. चीनकडील नवीन पाणबुड्या साधारणपणे ६० फूट लांबीच्या आहेत. आकाराने लहान व वजनाने हलक्या असलेल्या या पाणबुड्या शत्रूंची नजर चुकवून अगदी सहजपणे त्यांच्यावर हल्ला करू शकतात. चीनच्या लष्करी परेडच्या सरावादरम्यान अत्याधुनिक लढाऊ विमानं व काही ड्रोन्स दिसून आली. संरक्षण तज्ज्ञांच्या मते- ही विमानं चीनच्या ‘FH-97’ किंवा ‘Feihong-97’ लढाऊ विमानांसारखीच आहेत, तर ‘लॉयल विंगमॅन’ हे ड्रोन युद्धावेळी पायलटला मदत देण्यासाठी तयार करण्यात आलं आहे. गुप्त माहिती गोळा करणे व युद्धात मदत करणे यांसारखी कामे हे ड्रोन करू शकतात. ‘लॉयल विंगमॅन’ ड्रोनचा उद्देश पायलटचा ताण कमी करणे आणि मानवी जीवाला असलेला धोका कमी करणे हा आहे. अमेरिकेचे ‘XQ-58A’ हे ड्रोन २०२९ पर्यंत युद्ध-सज्ज होण्याची अपेक्षा आहे. चिनी तज्ज्ञ अँड्रियास रूप्रेचट यांच्या मते- चीनच्या परेडच्या सरावाने त्यांच्या अपेक्षांनाही मागे टाकलं आहे. चिनी सैन्याने केलेला परेडचा सराव अपेक्षेपेक्षा खूपच चांगला होता असं त्यांनी म्हटलं आहे. दरम्यान, ३ सप्टेंबर रोजी होणाऱ्या ७० मिनिटांच्या परेडमध्ये चीन आपली सर्वात आधुनिक शस्त्रे जगाला दाखवण्यासाठी सज्ज आहे. चिनी सैन्याचं हे प्रदर्शन त्यांच्या प्रतिस्पर्धी देशांसाठी चिंतेचं ठरू शकतं, असं तज्ज्ञांनी म्हटलं आहे. हेही वाचा :अमेरिकन डॉलरच्या वर्चस्वाला धक्का बसणार? चीनचं स्टेबलकॉइन्स आहे तरी काय? चीन जगातील सर्वात शक्तिशाली सैन्य तयार करण्याच्या दिशेने वेगाने वाटचाल करत आहे. यासाठी त्यांनी आपल्या लष्करी रचनेत मोठे बदल केले आहेत. चीनने आपल्या सर्व लष्करी भागांना पाच ‘थिएटर कमांड’मध्ये विभागलं आहे. यापैकी भारताच्या सीमेला लागून तैनात असलेल्या लष्करी तुकडीचे नाव ‘वेस्टर्न थिएटर कमांड’ आहे. या कमांडमध्ये चीनचे लष्कर व वायुदल एकाच वेळी तैनात आहेत. १९८० पासून चीनने आपल्या सैन्याचं आधुनिकीकरण सुरू केलं होतं. जागतिक दर्जाचे सैन्य तयार करण्यासाठी शी जिनपिंग यांनी २०१५ मध्ये दोन मोठे बदल केले. पहिला बदल ‘ऑर्गनायझेशनल, कमांड आणि कंट्रोल रिफॉर्म’ होता. याआधी चीनच्या लष्करात ‘पीएलए आर्मी, पीएलए नेव्ही, पीएलए एअरफोर्स आणि रॉकेट फोर्स’ या चारच मुख्य सेना होत्या. ‘ग्लोबल फायर पॉवर इंडेक्स २०२५’ नुसार- अमेरिका आणि रशियानंतर चीनकडे जगातील तिसऱ्या क्रमांकाचे सर्वात शक्तिशाली सैन्य आहे. चीनकडे २,०३५,००० सैनिक, ३,३०९ विमाने, ६,८०० रणगाडे, ३,४९० ‘सेल्फ-प्रोपेल्ड आर्टिलरी’ व २,७५० ‘मोबाईल रॉकेट प्रोजेक्टर’ आहेत.

        "raw_text": "Subscribe Now! Get features like Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday attacked the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, alleging that the opposing parties were against the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill as most of their leaders were either in jail or out on bail. The Bill proposes the removal of prime ministers, chief ministers and ministers if they are arrested or detained for 30 days over serious charges. Addressing a rally at Bodh Gaya after inaugurating and laying foundation stones of different projects worth₹13,000 crore, PM Modi alleged that the RJD and its allies consider people of Bihar only as their vote bank and that the people of Bihar know RJD leaders always indulge in corrupt practices. “No major project was completed in Bihar during the RJD and Congress regimes. They never thought about people’s betterment and were always busy filling their own pockets,” Modi said. Justifying the amendment, Modi said that, “Every child in Bihar knows about the RJD’s corruption. People expect transparency. The NDA government has brought a new Amendment to maintain this.” “The RJD, Congress, Left parties are opposing. They are angry. Who doesn’t know why they are afraid of it? Those who have committed a sin know what they have done. They know that if they land in jail all their dreams would be shattered. They are so angry that they are using all sorts of words against me,” Modi said. The PM further highlighted the perils of demographic imbalance due to infiltration and illegal migration in border areas and announced the launch of a high-powered ‘Demography Mission’ to address this national security challenge, ensuring the unity, integrity, and rights of India’s citizens are safeguarded. Modi claimed that demography was changing fast in the border districts of Bihar and accused the RJD and Congress of supporting the infiltrators. “The increasing population of illegal immigrants in the country is a matter of concern. In the bordering areas of Bihar, demography is rapidly changing. The NDA government has decided not to let illegal immigrants decide the future of our country. We will not let immigrants take away the jobs meant for the people of Bihar... To tackle this threat, I have proposed to start a demographic mission. This mission will begin its work shortly. We will throw out every immigrant... The people of Bihar must be wary of the supporters of these immigrants in the country... The Congress and RJD want to take away the rights of the people of Bihar and give them to immigrants for appeasement and to increase their vote bank…” The PM also said that people should be alert towards infiltrators within the country. “There are infiltrators inside the country as well. The RJD and Congress want your right to be given to them. Shouldn’t they be thrown out?” the Prime Minister said in a veiled attack on the ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ of the Grand Alliance currently underway in Bihar. Hailing Operation Sindoor, the PM said that India, through this operation, has sent a strong message that no adversary will be left “unpunished” and Indian missiles will strike and eliminate terrorists wherever they are. Recalling his first visit to the state after the Pahalgam attack, he said, “Bihar is the land of Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. Bihar has stood as the backbone of the country at all times. Every resolve made on this pious land is the strength of the country and doesn’t go in vain. When the Pahalgam terror attack happened, I had vowed from this land to reduce the terrorists to dust. The world has seen that resolve getting fulfilled.” “Pakistan was attacking us with drones and missiles but India was scattering Pakistan’s missiles in the air like twigs. Not even a single missile of Pakistan could cause any harm to us. Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line of India’s defence policy, sending a strong message that no adversary will go unpunished. Even if terrorists hide in the depths of hell, India’s missiles will track them down and eliminate them,” the PM added. He said, “The double-engine government is working continuously for the development of Gayaji. In a single day, projects worth₹13,000 crores were inaugurated or their foundation stones were laid in the holy land of Gayaji. These include several major projects related to energy, development and health. This will give strength to the industries of Bihar and create new employment opportunities for the youth. I congratulate the people of Bihar for this.” Prime Minister Modi further conveyed that facilities of electricity, water and gas connection have been provided in houses given to the beneficiaries of PM-Awas Yojana as he symbolically hands over keys to a few beneficiaries as part of the Grih Pravesh ceremony of 12,000 rural beneficiaries under PMAY-Gramin and 4,260 beneficiaries under PMAY-Urban. He stated, “I have a big resolution, until every needy person gets a pucca house, Modi will not sit. With this thought in mind, in the last 11 years, pucca houses have been built and given to more than 4 crore poor people. In Bihar alone, more than 38 lakh houses have been built and in Gaya more than 2 lakh families have got their own pucca houses. Along with these houses, the poor have got their self-respect. Facilities of electricity, water and gas connection have been provided in these houses.” The Prime Minister assured that the PM-Awas Yojana will continue to be implemented till every poor gets their own house. “Today, taking this series forward, more than 16,000 families of Magadh city of Bihar have been given their own pucca houses, which means this time the joy of Diwali and Chhath Puja will be even more in these families. I congratulate all the beneficiary families. I assure those who have missed out on the benefits of PM-Awas Yojana, the implementation of PM-Awas will continue till every poor person gets his own pucca house,” the Prime Minister said.",

Here’s your knowledge nugget on the Presidential reference._ (: The TN Governor case has been in the news for long. Any development regarding that is crucial from an exam perspective.

The Supreme Court, through its five-judge Constitution bench, is currently hearing the — after a two-Judge bench fixed timelines for the President and Governors to act on Bills sent by State Legislatures. The the Centre if a Governor has unlimited power to withhold a Bill for time immemorial, then what is the safeguard for a duly elected legislature. 1. President Droupadi Murmu has invoked the Supreme Court’s advisory jurisdiction on whether timelines could be set for the President and Governors to act on Bills passed by state Assemblies. The President has made a to the Supreme Court. You can read those questions. 2. Under , the President may refer a “question of law or fact” to the Supreme Court for its opinion. The opinion, unlike a ruling, is not binding. 3. The reference was made in May after the SC’s April 8 ruling in which it fixed a three-month deadline for the President to clear Bills reserved for her consideration by the Governor. That ruling, by a two-judge Bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala, set aside Governor R N Ravi’s decision to withhold assent to 10 pending Bills. 4. The of the Supreme Court under Article 143 is derived from the Government of India Act, 1935 which provided the power to the Governor-General to seek the opinion of the Federal Court on questions of law to questions of fact as well, including certain hypotheticals. requires any such reference to be heard byafter which the SC returns the reference to the President with the majority opinion. Under the Constitution, the President acts on the aid and advice of the Cabinet. The advisory jurisdiction allows her the means to seek independent advice to act on certain constitutional matters. 6. This power has been invoked by the President on since 1950. Notably, in two cases the Supreme Court has returned references without any answers. Highlighting that it is the prerogative of the Supreme Court to provide answers to the reference made by the President. 🔵 In 1993, then President Shankar Dayal Sharma asked the SC “whether a Hindu temple or any Hindu religious structure existed prior to the construction of the Ram Janma Bhumi-Babri Masjid…in the area on which the structure stood.” 🔵 The SC did not answer a 1982 reference made by President Giani Zail Singh on the constitutionality of a proposed law that sought to regulate the resettlement or permanent return of individuals (or their descendants) who had migrated to Pakistan between March 1, 1947 and May 14, 1954 to and Kashmir. 1. 143 (1) If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to that Court for consideration and the Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon. 2. The article provides that “the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference under article 143 shall be five.” 3. It says “ No judgment shall be delivered by the Supreme Court save in open Court, and no report shall be made under article 143 save in accordance with an opinion also delivered in open Court.” It means the judgment and advisory note made by the Supreme Court in regards to reference under Article 143 shall be in open court. 1. The 14 questions which are referred to by the President are mostly drawn from the April 8 ruling, but are not limited to it. The last three questions raise larger issues on how the SC exercises discretionary powers provided by the Constitution. Article 131 states that “subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Supreme Court shall, to the exclusion of any other court, have original jurisdiction in any dispute.” if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. 3. Article 32 of the Constitution gives an extensive original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights. The SC is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari to enforce them. 4. The of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) (civil matters) or 134 (criminal matters) of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. 5. A wide appellate jurisdiction has been provided to the SC over all Courts and Tribunals in India in as much as it may, in its discretion, grant to appeal under of the Constitution from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any Court or Tribunal in the territory of India.

        "raw_text": "In a decisive move to bolster security in Jammu and Kashmir, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha has terminated the services of two government employees for their alleged involvement in militancy-related activities. The announcement, made on August 22, 2025, underscores the region's ongoing battle against terrorism and the government's commitment to eliminatinginternal threats. The dismissed employees, Khurshid Ahmed Rather and Siyad Ahmad Khan, were reportedly linked to the banned terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Khurshid Ahmed Rather, a teacher in the School Education Department, was stationed at the Government Primary School in Maindpora Nawa Gabra, Kupwara. His tenure in government service began in 2003 as a Rehbar-e-Taleem (ReT), and he was confirmed as a teacher in 2008. Despite his educational role, Rather allegedly breached the trust placed in him by the government and became actively involved in subversive activities. Officials have accused him of being an overground worker for LeT, facilitating the smuggling of arms and ammunition into Indian territory. The allegations against Rather are serious. On January 25, 2024, police in Kupwara received credible information about two Pakistan-based LeT operatives, Manzoor Ahmad Sheikh and Qazi Mohammad Khushal, who were involved in smuggling arms across the border. Rather, along with other local associates, was reportedly instrumental in this operation, aimed at promoting terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and beyond. Consequently, a case was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Crackdown on Internal Threats Siyad Ahmad Khan, the other dismissed employee, served as a stock assistant in the Sheep Husbandry Department in Keran, Kupwara. His activities were described as secretive, aimed at avoiding detection by security forces. On January 12, 2024, Khan was intercepted by a police and army naka party at the Peer Baba Shrine in Keran while allegedly on a mission to supply arms to LeT terrorists. The search led to the recovery of an AK-47 from Khan and a pistol with ammunition from his associate, Rafaqat Ahmad Khan. This incident further cemented the allegations of Khan's deep involvement in unlawful activities. The dismissals were executed under Article 311(2)(c) of the Indian Constitution, which allows the government to terminate employees without an inquiry if it is deemed necessary for state security. This provision has been increasingly utilized since 2021, with dozens of government employees terminated for suspected links to terrorist groups. The crackdown on government employees with alleged terrorist links is part of a broader strategy to ensure the security and stability of Jammu and Kashmir. The region has been a focal point of militancy and separatist activities, necessitating stringent measures to curb any internal threats. The government's actions reflect a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of support for terrorism, especially from those within its ranks. The dismissals come in the wake of heightened security concerns following recent terrorist activities in the region. A month prior, the Pahalgam terror attack resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians, mostly tourists, in the Baisaran valley. This attack underscored the persistent threat posed by terrorist groups and the need for robust security measures. In response, Union Home Minister Amit Shah confirmed the elimination of three terrorists involved in the attack during a joint operation by the Indian Army, CRPF, and J&K Police. The government's decision to dismiss Rather and Khan is a clear message of its commitment to maintaining national security. By removing individuals with alleged terrorist links from government positions, the administration aims to prevent any potential threats from within. This approach is part of a larger effort to dismantle the support networks that enable terrorist activities in the region. Related",

        "raw_text": "Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor (LG) Manoj Sinha on Friday terminated two governmentemployeesfor terror links, invoking Article 311 (2) (c) of the Constitution. Painstaking investigation clearly established that they were acting on behalf of terror outfits, law enforcement and intelligence agencies had collected incriminating material evidence against them. Currently they are lodged at District Jail, Kupwara. In J&K, several individuals (like Khurshid) played the role of Pakistani proxies in schools, colleges and universities under the garb of ‘teaching’ or ‘non-teaching’ faculty for several decades. “If the education system is infected with people like Khurshid, the entire country will be put to real peril,\" the investigators observed. Since he joined as Lieutenant Governor,Sinhahas taken a firm stance against terrorism and its ecosystem. His zero-tolerance policy against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir is characterised by a multi-pronged approach that combines aggressive anti-terror operations, dismantling of support networks, strict legal action against facilitators, and community engagement to foster peace. By aligning with national security strategies and emphasising both security and development, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha’s policy aims to eliminate terrorism and establish lasting stability in the region. Khurshid Ahmad Rather (Teacher):Khurshid Ahmad Rather was appointed in government service in 2003 (temporary under Rehber-e-Talim) and got confirmed as a teacher in 2008. Khurshid was working as OGW for Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) terror organisation. Sources said that despite being paid by the government to fulfil his duty and impart education to youngsters, Khurshid became an active conduit for terrorist activities of LeT. Investigation has revealed that Khurshid was given assignment to procure arms, ammunition and narcotics by LeT handlers sitting in Pakistan for further distribution among active terrorists operating in the valley. He was in touch with Pakistan-based handlers Manzoor Ahmed Sheikh alias Shakoor and Javid Ahmed. The investigators have revealed that Khurshid had received several consignments containing weapons and narcotics through LoC at Karnah, Kupwara. Swipe Left For Next Video Siyad Ahmad Khan (Assistant Stockman- Sheep & Husbandry Department):Siyad Khan was appointed as Assistant Stockman in Sheep Husbandry Department in 2004. He willingly started working for Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and was tasked to receive infiltrating group of terrorists, sheltering them and transporting their arms and ammunition. According to investigators, Siyad Khan also started smuggling narcotics to sustain terror activities.

Siyad was arrested in 2024 and he is currently lodged in District Jail, Kupwara. The decision to terminate the employees with terror links was started by LG Sinha in 2021. With the sacking of two employees on Aug 21, the number of sacked employees for terror links has reached around 85.

Television footage showed thick smoke billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored. Broken glass from nearby shop windows littered the road as panicked residents rushed from the scene, witnesses said. Firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze while ambulances transported the injured, including passersby, to several hospitals, senior police official Asad Raza said. The blast damaged several shops and vehicles passing through an area known as Jinnah Road. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. Explosions at fireworks facilities are common in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, a city in the eastern Punjab province.(AP) 2 sailors injured in Japan warship fire WASHINGTON, Aug 21:A fire broke out on the USS New Orleans warship off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, causing minor injuries to two sailors. The fire lasted almost 12 hours and was extinguished, with the cause under investigation. The ship was in water near White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa. The crew of the USS San Diego, another warship, and the Japanese coast guard and military helped fight the fire. The USS New Orleans, commissioned in 2007, can hold up to 800 people. The fire follows another five-day fire on the USS Bonhomme Richard in July 2020, which was charged and acquitted of starting. The ship suffered extensive structural, electrical, and mechanical damage and was later scrapped.(AP) NZ soldier gets 2 years for attempted espionage WELLINGTON, Aug 21:A New Zealand soldier has been sentenced to two years in military prison and discharge from the army after admitting to spying for a foreign power. The soldier pleaded guilty to three charges, including attempted espionage, which was the first conviction for spying in New Zealand’s history. The soldier believed he was engaged with a foreign agent in 2019 when he tried to communicate military information, including base telephone directories, maps, assessments of security weaknesses, and his own identity card. The soldier’s name was suppressed.(AP) Indian student visas fall in UK, detentions up LONDON, Aug 21:Indian students granted visas to study at UK universities have continued to decline, with the majority opting for post-graduate qualifications. Indian students received 98,014 visa grants in the year ending June 2025, a close second to Chinese students at 99,919. However, both nationalities registered a fall in overall numbers compared to last year, with Indian students mainly studying for a Master’s degree.

        "description": "Pakistan : Rights group warns of surging violence against religious minorities",
        "raw_text": "Date: Share post: Islamabad, Aug 22: A leading minority rights group has raised serious concerns over the escalating violence and systemic persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, warning that Christians, Hindus, Ahmadiyyas, Sikhs, and others continue to face increasing marginalisation, targeted attacks, and social exclusion under the country’s prevailing religious intolerance. Citing a latest report by the Washington-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), the Voice of Pakistan Minority (VOPM) said findings revealed that the state of religious freedom in Pakistan is “increasingly dire.” The report noted that despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, minorities in Pakistan live under constant threat, with little hope of justice. The VOPM asserted that central to this persecution is Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy law, which has been widely misused to intimidate, settle personal disputes, or extort money. It added that accusations alone—whether true or fabricated—are often enough to spark mob violence against religious minorities in the country. “Hindus, Pakistan’s largest minority, continue to face violence and forced conversions. In 2019, a blasphemy accusation against Hindu teacher Notan Lal in Sindh triggered riots: Hindu shops were looted, a school ransacked, and a temple attacked. Though Lal was acquitted in 2024, his case is a reminder of how quickly allegations can ignite communal violence. In 2020, a historic temple in Karak was torched by a mob protesting its expansion, despite Supreme Court orders for protection,” read a statement issued by the rights body. According to VOPM, women and girls from minority communities often face persecution in the form of abduction and forced conversion, with the CSOH report noting that Hindu and Christian girls are particularly at risk. Highlighting the atrocities against minorities in Pakistan, the rights body stated that in December 2024, a 15-year-old Hindu girl, Kajol was abducted from her home in Sindh province, and then tortured, raped, converted, and forced into marriage. Her name was changed to “Javeriya,” and her age was falsified to make the marriage appear legal. Despite appeals from her family, the VOPM said she remains trapped with her abductors. Additionally, the rights body mentioned that in March 2024, a 10-year-old Christian girl, Laiba, was kidnapped from her home in Punjab province, forcibly converted to Islam, and married to her 35-year-old abductor, while documents were falsified to show she was 17. Instead of returning her to her parents, a Pakistani court ordered that she be kept in a state-run shelter. Similarly, raising concern over the violence faced by minority men as well, the VOPM stated that in March 2025, Hindu sanitation worker Nadeem Naath was shot dead in Peshawar after refusing to convert to Islam. In the same month, it said 22-year-old Christian labourer Waqas Masih survived an attack by his supervisor, who slit his throat after pressuring him to abandon his faith. “The persecution of Pakistan’s minorities is not only a political and legal issue—it is a deeply human tragedy. It is about families who lose their homes overnight, young girls robbed of their childhoods, and entire communities forced to live in fear,” the VOPM stated. “And yet, amid this fear, these communities show remarkable resilience. Christians continue to rebuild burned churches, Hindus fight for their temples, Ahmadiyyas stand firm in their faith, and Sikhs strive to keep their culture alive,” it added.

        "raw_text": "Freedom of the press cannot be deliberately, arbitrarily and vengefullycurtailed by police action! Repeal Section 152 of the BNS which is nothing but the sedition law indecolonial garb! The PUCL is outraged at the vindictive action of the Assam police in summoning renowned journalists Siddharth Varadarajan and Karan Thapar for investigation in a 2ndFIR on the same allegation with the difference being that the FIR was registered in a different police station in another district. The 1stFIR for which too they were summoned for police investigation, related to an article reporting a statement of the Indian Attache to Indonesia regarding military tactics adopted during Operation Sindoor and IAF jets. The FIR accused the article of constituting acts “endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India”. Ironically, the summons were issued by the Assam police in the 2ndFIR on 12thAugust, 2025, which is the same day that the Supreme Court ruled that there was to be no coercive action against Varadarajan and Thapar with respect to the first FIR by the Assam police registered against them on 11thJuly, 2025. With respect to the fresh summons issued in the 2ndFIR, according to the Wire, no details of the alleged offence were provided by police which summoned them to appear before the police on 22ndAugust, 2025. The first FIR was filed with respect to offences under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS): Sec. 152 (act endangering sovereignty); sec. 196 (promoting enmity among groups); sec. 197(1)(D)/3(6) (imputations prejudicial to national integration read with common intention), sec.353 (statements conducing to public mischief), sec. 45 (abetment) and sec. 61(criminal conspiracy). The FIR invokes Section 152, BNS which criminalises speech which ‘encourages feelings of separatist activities or endangers sovereignty or unity and integrity of India’. The facts in the FIR pertain to a report by the Wire which dealt with a statement made by India’s defence attaché to Indonesia, Captain (Indian Navy) Shiv Kumar. Shiv Kumar acknowledged at a seminar in Indonesia that the Indian Air Force lost fighter jets to Pakistan on the night of 7thMay, 2025, during Operation Sindoor, because of the “constraint given by the political leadership to not attack the military establishment or their air defences”. When the summons as well as the constitutionality of Section 152 of the BNS was challenged before the Supreme Court, the Court ordered that ‘no coercive action shall be taken against them (Siddharth Varadarajan and Karan Thapar) and agreed to hear the constitutional challenge to Section 152. During the hearings, the Bench observed that when the offence is with respect to articles published by a news outlet, custodial interrogation may not be necessary. “Basically these are matters where you don’t require custodial interrogation” the apex court reportedly pointed out. However, the Assam police does not seem to want to heed the implicit message in the Supreme Court order which is that freedom of speech cannot be recklessly and arbitrarily curtailed by police action. Only this heedless lack of concern for the Constitution can explain a second FIR against Varadarajan and Thapar. The two FIR’s are a part of a pattern to attempt to stifle the independent voice of ‘The Wire’. It should be pointed out that on 9thMay,The Wire’swebsite was temporarily blocked for nearly 12-15 hours in India on government orders following the publication ofan article regarding Rafale jets in Operation Sindoor.The website was restored later. All of this indicates a capricious attempt by the State to weaponise the law to silence questioning of state policy by the media and citizens, thereby curbing media freedoms and causing a `chilling effect’. The indifference of the state to its constitutional responsibility to ensure freedom of the press is only aided by Section 152 of the BNS. Sec. 152 of the BNS through its vague and over broad language criminalises what should otherwise be covered by the freedom of the press. Surely it is not an offence to fairly and accurately report what a serving military officer says! The fact that Section 152 gives the government a wide latitude to arbitrarily criminalise media reporting alleging that it constitutes ‘encouragement’ of ‘feelings of separatist activities’ and the endangerment of the ‘sovereignty or unity and integrity of India’, strikes at the very basis of media freedom and freedom of speech and expression.

The PUCL demands that the Assam police stop this vindictive, malicious and unconstitutional persecution of the press now and withdraw the FIR against Varadarajan and Thapar.

        "raw_text": "Mackay (Australia), Aug 22 (IANS) South Africa wicketkeeper batter Matthew Breetzke created history on Friday as he became the first batter in ODI history to start his career with four consecutive scores of 50-plus. Breetzke achieved the feat during the second ODI against Australia after scoring a powerful 88 off 78 at the Great Barrier Reef Arena, surpassing former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu's 48-year-old record. Notably, Sidhu had started his career with four consecutive fifties, but those came across five matches, while Breetzke has played only four ODIs and scored half-centuries in each. Breetzke already holds a world record to his name, having become the player with the highest score on ODI debut when he smashed 150, his first 50-plus score in his first match against New Zealand in Lahore earlier this year. His second half-century came in the same series against Pakistan, in which he scored 83. The wicketkeeper-batter played a 57-run knock in the opening match of the three-match series, which the Proteas won by 98 runs, courtesy of spinner Keshav Maharaj's fifer. The 26-year-old came to bat at number four on Friday, and his innings saw him score eight boundaries and two maximums before he was dismissed by Nathan Ellis and fell short of his century. Breetzke's innings helped stabilise the Proteas innings after two early wickets, with Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton both falling early on in the powerplay. Breetzke stitched together handy partnerships with both Tony de Zorzi (38) and Tristan Stubbs (74). Stubbs' knock came off 97 balls and was studded with three fours and one six. After Breetzke's dismissal, the Proteas lost wickets in quick succession and are currently reeling at 264/9 with Nandre Burger and Lungi Ngidi at the crease. They were eventually bundled out for 277 in 49.1 overs. Breetzke secured an IPL contract and made his debut for the Lucknow Super Giants in this year’s tournament. However, he had limited opportunities, featuring in just one match where he scored 14 runs. --IANS bc/bsk/ IANS India Private LimitedA-6, Ground Floor, Block ASector-16, Noida, Uttar PradeshPhone:+91-120-4822400, 4822415, 4822416Email:,",

        "description": "Opinion | A Pakistani Dilemma : American Dream Or Chinese Money ?",
        "raw_text": "To be called a Paki is unacceptable for a Pakistani in the outside world. It is more of a slur. Pakistanis themselves acknowledge this, and it is a well-known secret globally. The country thrives and is proud of its largest industry – begging. Begging contributes more than 12 per cent of its GDP, translating to $42 billion dollars. The national average amount per beggar is Rs 850, and in a country with over 230 million people, there are reportedly 38 million beggars. From January 2024 to May 2025, a maximum of 5,402 Pakistani citizens, primarily beggars, were deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE. On the other hand, Pakistan’s top export is terror. Pervez Musharraf, the former Pakistani General and dictator, was extremely proud of the association with terrorists. Senior military leadership and politicians openly flaunt their relationships with world-designated terrorists and attend their burials. All major terror strikes, including the Twin Tower attack of 9/11, Mumbai terror attack of 26/11, and the London Subway bombings, have links to Pakistan. The elimination of Osama bin Laden, the notorious Al Qaeda terrorist leader, by the Americans in Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad, Pakistan, demonstrated how far the Pakistani leadership goes to protect a terror asset, even from an ally. The world was amused that Pakistan was fighting the Global War on Terror while being funded with billions of dollars by the Americans. Recently, after Operation Sindoor, Pakistan’s leadership, both military and political, willingly exposed their intimate linkages at terrorists’ burials and during subsequent marches. Yet, due to its geostrategic location, Pakistan continues to be coveted by the USA and China. It is surprising that while China is a stable partner, the Pakistani establishment craves the USA, which is extremely unreliable. There are compulsions, primarily for the elites, Generals, politicians, and wealthy businesses, to park the riches looted from poor Pakistanis living on the opium of religion. The West, especially the US and UK, provides a safe haven for the loot and a hiding place post-retirement or when people come after them. Pakistan, created by the British due to intense hatred of Indians and geopolitical considerations, leaned towards the USA early after partition. They signed on to be the USA’s proxy in the region against India, perceived to be socialist, against Soviets dominating the region through Afghanistan, and as a buffer against communist China. Pakistan’s leadership followed the Chanakyan path, “Enemy’s enemy is a friend,\" and engaged with China immediately after the defeat of Indian forces in the 1962 debacle. It made strategic sense and mitigated fear through positive engagement with a powerful country. After the 1962 betrayal and loss of face, while India pulled away from flawed perceptions of peaceful outcomes of Panchsheel and “Hindi Cheeni Bhai Bhai\" slogans, Pakistan stepped in, making deep inroads into China. They quickly overlooked the Aksai Chin takeover and voluntarily gifted Shaksgam Valley, territory difficult for India to dominate at the time due to lack of suitable infrastructure. Pakistan’s strategic masterstroke was midwifing the friendship between Americans and Chinese in the 1960s. It was the most prominent gift they gave to China, isolated at the time, by becoming the bridge to the USA. A gross strategic miscalculation by American thinker Kissinger, who matched the Pakistanis in their hatred of Indians. The Americans opened up to communist China in multiple ways, not realising that the sleeping dragon follows Sun Tzu’s principles to deceive. It was ironic that the 20th-century world saw opposing ideologies—largest capitalist Christian democracy and atheist communist party dictatorship—brought together by a country with an ideology based on Islam, conflicting with Christianity, and largely under military dictatorship. China steadily became Pakistan’s iron brother, while Pakistan continued to be the clear USA proxy in the region. Pakistan fought wars for American interests, created the Taliban, and radicalised its own people into Islamist Jihadis to fight in Afghanistan against Soviets. Once successful, the Americans left, having radicalised Pakistani society and left behind arms and ammunition. Pakistanis were brought in again to fight the GWOT as the American proxy against the Taliban, their creation, early in the 21st century. This divided Pakistani society, but leadership had no choice as the leverage was with Americans in multiple ways. During this period, Pakistan started to pivot firmly towards China. Emerging from economic isolation, China was flush with surplus funds, heavy machinery, and necessary infrastructure to kickstart growth, economic activity, and create jobs in Pakistan. CPEC came at the right time, as China sought new trade routes to supplement existing sea routes, shortening the time to access markets in West Asia and beyond, and providing redundancy safeguards. Pakistan was compliant and a willing proxy against India through conventional stretch and terrorist activities. Americans left Pakistan, and the Chinese stepped in. Geography played a cruel joke on Pakistan. China slowly embraced Pakistan in a dragon debt claw, with no escape. China brought its machinery, experienced labour, and extended high-interest credit. The leadership was bought, silenced, and tasked with protecting Chinese assets meant for Chinese goods and trade, with little benefit for the population. Aggressive Chinese officials and labour challenged local sensitivities. Insurgent attacks on Chinese and assets made CPEC through Pakistani territory a major security threat. Having made long-term commitments and signed on the dotted line, Pakistanis had no choice but to play second fiddle. The only silver lining was modern defence products from China, though they were untested in live operations. Chinese also engaged intimately with Pakistani military officers through numerous training courses and exercises, providing technical support along the IB and Line of Control to assist and monitor Indian Armed Forces activities. America remained an obvious dreamland for Pakistanis, civilians, elites, Generals, and politicians alike. Corrupt funds were parked, and freedom enjoyed in Western countries was not available in Pakistan or China. This shift was evident during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan dialled America, not China, despite sourcing 80 per cent of defence equipment and billions in debt and investments in CPEC and other infrastructure projects from China. The Americans had long abandoned Pakistan after the hurried Afghanistan withdrawal, with no decent visit or conversation at any level. Article 370’s abrogation was ignored by Sweater powers, including America. Whereas, China made supportive noises for Pakistan, particularly regarding terror activities in international forums. China felt left out and not consulted, as evident by the sharp response from Chinese leadership to Pakistanis. America was back in the game, likely because its assets were hit by Indian Armed Forces, presumably kept for Russian contingency. Pakistan pivoted easily towards the US, offering personal trade deals to the American President’s relatives and Nobel recommendations for the President. The top Pakistani Army General promoted himself to Field Marshal and solicited for the White House Lunch, bypassing civilian hierarchy. The reason is obvious: American power is waning but still influential, appreciated for colonial comforts unlike disciplined, corruption-unappreciative China. On the run, US, UK, or Saudi are safer options than China. Pakistan’s frequent pivoting may seem like strategic opportunity extraction. But the country’s resources are being rapidly depleted. Gilgit Baltistan, a resource-rich area, has been laid bare by China, bypassing local and environmental concerns. In the West, Baluchistan is now sold to American companies for mineral extraction, with Pakistani military securing Chinese and American interests. Swipe Left For Next Video Pakistan is torn between two exploitative powers at either end of its strategic geography. Opportunistic elites have led the country to become a proxy for America and China, with no real benefits to the population, who continue down the path of religious radicalisation, an opium of the mind, substantiated by locally-grown and illegally imported opium from Afghanistan.

        "description": "Pakistan : Rights group warns of surging violence against religious minorities",
        "raw_text": "Islamabad, Aug 22 (IANS) A leading minority rights group has raised serious concerns over the escalating violence and systemic persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, warning that Christians, Hindus, Ahmadiyyas, Sikhs, and others continue to face increasing marginalisation, targeted attacks, and social exclusion under the country’s prevailing religious intolerance. Citing a latest report by the Washington-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), the Voice of Pakistan Minority (VOPM) said findings revealed that the state of religious freedom in Pakistan is “increasingly dire.” The report noted that despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, minorities in Pakistan live under constant threat, with little hope of justice. The VOPM asserted that central to this persecution is Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy law, which has been widely misused to intimidate, settle personal disputes, or extort money. It added that accusations alone—whether true or fabricated—are often enough to spark mob violence against religious minorities in the country. “Hindus, Pakistan’s largest minority, continue to face violence and forced conversions. In 2019, a blasphemy accusation against Hindu teacher Notan Lal in Sindh triggered riots: Hindu shops were looted, a school ransacked, and a temple attacked. Though Lal was acquitted in 2024, his case is a reminder of how quickly allegations can ignite communal violence. In 2020, a historic temple in Karak was torched by a mob protesting its expansion, despite Supreme Court orders for protection,” read a statement issued by the rights body. According to VOPM, women and girls from minority communities often face persecution in the form of abduction and forced conversion, with the CSOH report noting that Hindu and Christian girls are particularly at risk. Highlighting the atrocities against minorities in Pakistan, the rights body stated that in December 2024, a 15-year-old Hindu girl, Kajol was abducted from her home in Sindh province, and then tortured, raped, converted, and forced into marriage. Her name was changed to “Javeriya,” and her age was falsified to make the marriage appear legal. Despite appeals from her family, the VOPM said she remains trapped with her abductors. Additionally, the rights body mentioned that in March 2024, a 10-year-old Christian girl, Laiba, was kidnapped from her home in Punjab province, forcibly converted to Islam, and married to her 35-year-old abductor, while documents were falsified to show she was 17. Instead of returning her to her parents, a Pakistani court ordered that she be kept in a state-run shelter. Similarly, raising concern over the violence faced by minority men as well, the VOPM stated that in March 2025, Hindu sanitation worker Nadeem Naath was shot dead in Peshawar after refusing to convert to Islam. In the same month, it said 22-year-old Christian labourer Waqas Masih survived an attack by his supervisor, who slit his throat after pressuring him to abandon his faith. “The persecution of Pakistan’s minorities is not only a political and legal issue—it is a deeply human tragedy. It is about families who lose their homes overnight, young girls robbed of their childhoods, and entire communities forced to live in fear,” the VOPM stated. “And yet, amid this fear, these communities show remarkable resilience. Christians continue to rebuild burned churches, Hindus fight for their temples, Ahmadiyyas stand firm in their faith, and Sikhs strive to keep their culture alive,” it added. --IANS int/scor/rs IANS India Private LimitedA-6, Ground Floor, Block ASector-16, Noida, Uttar PradeshPhone:+91-120-4822400, 4822415, 4822416Email:,",

Highlighting WIM’s mission to connect and inspire women worldwide, Dr. Segera stated, “Our mission transcends borders, focusing on creating a supportive ecosystem that enables women to achieve their full potential while contributing to their communities and economies.” Reflecting on WIM’s 15-year journey, Dr. Segera said, “When I started WIM, it was a small voice advocating for women in Sri Lanka. Today, it is a global movement that connects leaders, entrepreneurs, and change makers across continents.” She emphasised that their initiatives are about impact, not just marketing. Highlighting WIM’s contributions throughout the years, she noted, “From providing free meals to schoolchildren to awarding scholarships and empowering over 100,000 women across Sri Lanka before going global, WIM has stayed true to its mission of empowerment. Global Week is not just a celebration it is a call to action.” Dr. Segera also shared that the Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards is a global platform, adding, “We have already received nominations from 12 countries, with a target of reaching 20.” She explained a significant change for this year’s awards event, stating, “We brought in a new category, the Women MSME Awards, and plan to give it more prominence to ensure the MSME segment gets the increased visibility it deserves.” In addition, she highlighted WIM’s belief in the importance of recognising the middle management in Sri Lanka, who she says are “truly running our companies.” She explained the reason for introducing the Next Tier Mentorship & Awards, stating it was more than just an award, as participants will be mentored by local and global experts. She noted that WIM is not just celebrating achievements but also actively contributing to professional development. Commenting on the awards, the Top 50 Professional and Career Women Global Awards 2025 Judging Panel Chairperson Gowri Rajan said, “The Top 50 Awards honour not just individual excellence but the collective strength of women who inspire generations.” She explained how the platform will recognise a diverse spectrum of women from entrepreneurs to next-generation leaders while also fostering global economic dialogue. The Women MSME Awards Judging Panel Chairperson Minoli Wickramasinghe, highlighted the key role of small and medium sized enterprises in national development. She stated that, “MSME’s are the engine of a nation’s growth,” emphasising that supporting them is crucial for building innovation, resilience, and long-term prosperity. Wickramasinghe added that the awards will address pressing socioeconomic challenges by recognising MSMEs and providing mentorship to help them overcome barriers and reach the next level. The press conference was also addressed by the Next Tier Mentorship and Awards Judging Panel Chairperson Kasturi Chelleraja Wilson who spoke about the significance of the program for emerging leaders.

        "raw_text": "Our mission is to promote and facilitate civic engagement and neighborhood empowerment, and to hold area government and its politicians accountable. THE VIEW FROM HERE -Useful Idiots comprise a significant category of Russian assets.The last few days demonstrate Trump is delusional.One example is his claim that he has settled six wars; in reality Trump has settled no wars.There have been some cease fires, but all the participants deny that Trump was instrumental in the cease fires. Trump is either delusional and believes his has settled the never-ending war between Pakistan and India or he is delusional in believing that everyone believes him.Likewise with his trade agreements.When Trump is unable to reach a trade agreement, he unilaterally imposes tariffs and calls it an agreement. For world leaders, the takeaway from the February 28thOval Office blow-up between Trump and Zelenskyy is that Trump is uncontrollably unhinged.There was no provocation in Zelenskyy’s recounting the bad experience with the 2019 cease fire which Zelenskyy had negotiated with Putin, Macron, and German chancellor Angela Merkel, but which Putin violated by attacking Ukraine is 2022.Zelenskyy was pointing out what everyone else knew about diplomacy and Putin by asking, \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\"That’s when Trump had a mental breakdown and flew into a Narcissistic Rage.Since then, all world leaders treat Trump like a lunatic, always praising and thanking for all the wonderful things he has done.They sit through oval office press conferences stoney faced as Trump tells lie after lie after lie. Obviously, the World Leaders Know That Trump Is Wacko Most Americans have come to accept Trump’s mental illness as normal.This column, however, pointed out in December 2016 and many times thereafter that Trump is mentally unstable.The conundrum facing the world now is whether Trump is delusional in his belief that Putin likes him and Putin wants to make a deal “for” him.Trump’s open-mic comment to French President Emmanuel Macron is apropos: “\"I think he [Putin] wants to make a deal for me. Do you understand? As crazy as it sounds.\"Yes., Donald; you are crazy. Trump has been touting that Putin told him during his Friday evening phone conversation that Putin is agreeable a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy.The transcript of the phone call disagrees. Putin said no such thing.Trump’s belief is all the more dangerous as it shows he fails to grasp the first thing about Putin, to wit, Ukraine is part of Russia and Zelenskyy is, therefore, an illegitimate President.That is why Putin would not allow Trump to have Zelenskyy at the meeting in Alaska.It should truly frighten Americans that Trump allowed Putin to tell the USA who we may or may not invite to a meeting on its own soil! More frightening than Trump’s failure to grasp why Putin invaded Ukraine and will continue the killing unless he is militarily stopped is Trump’s complete ignorance how government functions and his mind-numbing ignorance America’s constitutional requirements for treaties.Trump believes as President he is the law and that everything is a personal deal between himself and another leader and each alleged agreement is separate and distinct from every other agreement.Saying that America would give guarantees to Ukraine sounds like a five-year-old who still believes in magical thinking.Trump lacks the analytical ability to realize that to be enforceable, the military guarantee would require a treaty, and a 2/3rds vote by the US Senate. The common law principle that “no man including the king is above the law” is in the Magna Carta (1215 C.E.).King John was forced to sign the Magna Carta in 1215 because he had departed from that principle which dated back to the codes of the Anglo-Saxon King Alfred the Great of Wessex (847 - 899 C.E.) Furthermore, that legal principle had to be part of the prior Anglo Saxon tradition in order for Alfred to codify it.Trump appears to be so absorbed in his narcissistic grandiosity that nothing outside himself is real.Surely, advisors have tried to enlighten Trump, but his but inner emotional pathology is like a rubber band which snaps back as soon as one lets go. As needs to be explored in another article, our present Supreme Court likewise rejects our collective 1,200 years of jurisprudence that even the King is not above law.According to Chief Justice Roberts, King Trump has immunity to commit criminal acts if he declares they are part of his duties.King Charles I was beheaded for making that claim. It Is Possible Trump Did Not Know That the KGB Had Groomed Him to Be a Russian Asset? Back in 1987 when Trump went on his KGB trip to Russia, all foreign visitors of any note were constantly taped, videoed, and followed.It is vital to realize that the Soviet Ambassador to the United States Yuri Dubinin had singled out and had invited Trump in 1986.Yuri Dubinin already knew about Trump since his daughter Natalia had read about Trump Towers before Dubinin arranged to be seated next to Trump at the luncheon by Leonard Lauder, the businessman son of Estée Lauder.Coincidences happen and so do arranged meetings.At this luncheon, Dubinin invited Trump to Moscow.In a dictatorship, ambassadors do not extend such invitations unless they are so ordered.The KGB had targeted Trump and it planned, supervised, and bugged each and every aspect of Trump’s visit. Trump stayed [at] a KGB hotel and everyone with whom he came into contact was KGB agent.(SeeThe Hill, February 26, 2025, “Was 40-year-old Trump Recruited by the KGB?”)The KGB’s goal was to recruit more foreign sources.(SeePolitico Magazine, The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow) While the KGB seems to have been a rather poorly functioning agency during the 1970s’ and 1980's, it was not irrational.A source did not need to know he was a target or that his new friend was a KGB agent.Ambassador Dubinin did not open his conversation with Trump by asking, “How would you like to be a traitor to America and spy for the Soviet Union?”The KGB is not a charity, and it did not arrange for Trump to stay at a KGB hotel as a good will gesture.Nor did they have the blabber mouth Trump come to Moscow just to find out information which Trump would spill in NYC.The KGB wanted total control and have a variety of “interrogators” and honey pots set up [for] Trump.Before Trump arrived, the Soviets knew he inherited his wealth and that Trump was quite bad with money.They had to realize that Trump would not make a knowing Russian asset.Due to his mental troubles, Trump could not be trusted to keep a secret.Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the KGB never revealed the true purpose of Trump’s trip but instead kept up the charade, for years, pretending that they wanted him to build Trump Tower like hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. Nor Should We Overlook Trump’s Serious Daddy Issues Donald Trump has a deep Father Complex due to his experience with his father Fred Sr., who emotionally abused both Donald and his older brother Fred Jr.Donald had to watch his father drive Fred Jr. to alcoholism and then into an early grave at 42.Trump has projected his search for the ideal, nurturing father onto Vladimir Putin, whose psychopathy parallels Trump Sr’s manipulative abusive personality.SeeUSA Todayfor a brilliant article on this issue Everyone should realize: (1) Trump will never impose sanctions on Putin and (2) Trump will never allow Ukraine to have the military wherewithal to throw Russia out of Ukraine.However, Putin’s initiating this round of nonsense indicates that Putin is facing far more serious consequences from the war than the West realizes.While Europe stopped Trump from forcing Zelenskyy to surrender, they are now embroiled in these absurd discussions about security guarantees.Right now, Ukraine is supposedly protected by the 1994 Security Guarantee which proved worthless.Furthermore, there is no way in Hell the US Senate would ratify such a treaty obligation by a 2/3rd margin. It will be interesting to see (1) whether Europe can maneuver around Trump’s mental illness, and (2) whether Trump ever realizes that he is Putin’s “Useful Idiot.” (Richard Lee Abramsis a Los Angeles-based attorney, author, and political commentator.

        "raw_text": "Neomejen dostop | že od 14,99€ Čeririn Sarje novo ime med osvojenimi vrhovi. Na 6224 metrov visoko goro v pakistanski verigi Karakorum sta pred nedavnimprva stopilanaš vrhunski alpinist, dobitnik dveh cepinovAleš Česenin njegov avstrijski soplezalecLukas Wörle. Bil je popoln izlet v neznano, prava avantura, kar je tudi bistvo alpinizma, je podvig opisal najuspešnejši slovenski alpinist v letih 2017, 2018 in 2024. Čeprav se tistim, ki le prek medijev spremljamo podvige najdrznejših, zdi, da ni vrha, kamor ne bi stopila človeška noga, je seznam deviških še vedno dolg. Luka Stražar in Aleš Česen prejemnika Bloudkovega plakete Predvsem pa je ta seznam precej izmuzljiv, kakor je najbrž tudi pričakovano pri raziskovanju tako težko dostopnega sveta. Zatika se že pri določitvi, kaj je neosvojeni vrh, saj so številne odprave slabo dokumentirane (če sploh so), tudi zemljevidi pogosto pomanjkljivi, zaradi česar jih je že težko najti. Kljub temu večina virov kot najvišjega še neosvojenega navaja vrh Gangkhar Pensum, 7570 metrov visoko goro na meji med Butanom in Tibetom. Doslej so vrh gore, za katero veljajo ocene, da je 40. najvišja na svetu (naj spomnimo, da je vseh 14 osemtisočakov že osvojenih), menda poskusili osvojiti vsaj štirikrat, a so alpiniste vsakič premagale ekstremne vremenske razmere, ozebline in druge tegobe. Seznam neuspehov se Butancem morda niti ni zdel nepričakovan, saj verjamejo, da so njihove gore, tudi omenjena, domovanje božanstev in duhov, ki se ne pustijo motiti. Gangkhar Pensum velja za najvišjo še neosvojeno goro. FOTO: Wikimedia Commons Tudi butanska vlada se je strinjala z domačini in leta 1994 prepovedala gorništvo nad 6000 metri, slabo desetletje pozneje je to odločitev še podkrepila in prepovedala kakršenkoli alpinizem na gori. Pet let pred tem je dovoljenje za vzpon od Kitajskega alpinističnega združenja sicer dobila japonska odprava, vendar je Butan sprožil pravi politični spor in dosegel, da so ga preklicali. Je pa taista ekipa leto pozneje uspešno preplezala 7534 metrov visok stranski vrh, ki ga od glavnega loči dva kilometra dolg greben. Vsaj dokler butanska vlada ne bo preklicala prepovedi, kaže, da bo Gangkhar Pensumostal deviški vrh, kakor imenujejo neosvojene gore. Prepoved pristopa zaradi verskih prepričanj je sicer razlog, da je vrh nedotaknjen v več primerih; takšna je, denimo, tudi gora Kailaš v prefekturi Ngari v avtonomni regiji Tibet na Kitajskem z nadmorsko višino 6638 metrov. Za sveto velja v kar štirih verah: hinduizmu, budizmu, džainizmu in avtohtoni manjšinski tibetanski religiji bon. Zaradi tega potekajo tja vsako leto romanja, kakršnekoli plezalne dejavnosti pa so prepovedane. Katera je najvišja neosvojena gora, ki ni prepovedana, je težko ugotoviti. Nekateri vrhovi, ki se po različnih zapisih dvigajo nad sedem tisoč metri, so tako deviški, da še imen nimajo, pri nekaterih tudi ni verodostojnih podatkov o višini. Med zanesljivo najvišjimi gorami, na vrh katerih se še ni prebil noben alpinist, je Lapče Kang III s 7250 metri v Tibetu v severni Himalaji (približno 35 kilometrov od bistveno bolj znanega Čo Ojuja). Edini poskus vzpona na vrh je izvedla poljska ekipa, vendar je bila odprava neuspešna. Še ena neosvojena gora na meji med Butanom in Kitajsko je Tongshanjiabu (7207 metrov). Če je verjeti zapisom na spletu, so bile prve fotografije tega vrha posnete šele leta 2000, znan je le en poskus vzpona, lotili so se ga japonski alpinisti. Pravo kraljestvo deviških gora je tudi Karakorum, kjer je enega od takih vrhov skupaj s soplezalcem osvojil Aleš Česen. Ogromni masiv leži v regijah Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan), Ladak (Indija) in ujgurski avtonomni pokrajini Šindžjang (LR Kitajska). Približno 500 kilometrov dolgo pogorje je najbolj ledeniški del sveta zunaj polarnih območij in domovanje štirih vrhov nad osem tisoč metri, med njimi je drugi najvišji vrh na svetu K2 (8611 metrov). Himalaja je domovanje desetih od 14 osemtisočakov, vsi so že osvojeni. FOTO: Viki Grošelj Vse do lani je bila ena najvišjih neosvojenih gora na svetu Muču Čiš(7453) v dolini Hunza v Gilgit-Baltistanu, potem pa se je na vrh gore, ki jo obdaja ledenik Batura, v drugem poskusu vendarle uspešno povzpela tričlanska češka ekipa. Še vedno pa je neosvojen Suma Ri, visok približno 7300 metrov, prav tako Apsarasas Kangri I (7245 metrov) in Prakpa Kangri (približno 7135 m), znan tudi kot Prakpa Ri. V letih 2016 in 2021 sta bila zabeležena dva poskusa vzpona nanj, vendar nobeden ni bil uspešen. Aleš Česen je neosvojeni svet v Karakorumu odkrival že pred slabim letom dni, ko je skupaj z britanskim alpinistomTomom Livingstonomsplezal prvenstveno smer po zahodnem grebenu naGašerbrum III. Tokrat se je vrnil v mogočni masiv v navezi z Avstrijcem Lukasom Wörlejem. Njun prvotni načrt je bil preplezati najvišjo goro nad dolino Khurdopin Sar (6310 metrov), vendar sta idejo zaradi nevarnih razmer opustila, kot so njune načrte povzeli pri Planinski zvezi Slovenije. Osredotočila sta se na rezervni cilj, na prav tako še neosvojeni Čeririn Sar. Rekordnih devetnajstkrat na vrhu sveta Prvi pristop na dobrih 6220 metrov visoko goro jima je uspel po zahodni strani, kjer sta preplezala 2400 metrov dolgo smer Chicken Hunt oziroma Lov na kokoši. Ime prvenstvene smeri sta skovala na podlagi pripetljajev na poti: »Ko smo dosegli bazni tabor, smo pogrešali sveže piščančje meso. Na aklimatizacijski turi sva z Lukasom na območju tabora opazila kar nekaj gorskih kokoši in tako smo bolj za šalo kot zares poskusili ujeti nekaj svežega mesa. Mislim, da mi ni treba razlagati, da je bil lov daleč od uspešnega,« je pojasnil Česen. Čeririn Sar v Karakorumu ne sodi več med neosvojene vrhe. FOTO: Vincent Wörle V nadaljevanju je imelo bistveno bolj pomembno vlogo kot kokoši vreme: dež, veter, spet dež, snežna nevihta in naposled nekaj vedrine. Vrh sta dosegla 29. julija. »Čeprav plezanje v alpinističnem smislu ni bilo zelo zahtevno, je bila predvsem pri plezanju navzdol potrebna popolna zbranost, saj ledena zahodna pobočja niso dovoljevala nobene napake,« je zadnji del osvajanja neosvojene gore opisal slovenski alpinist. O tamkajšnjih gorah sta imela pred podvigom zelo malo informacij, še največ sta jih pridobila s satelitskih slik. »Ko sva prvič zagledala to skupino vrhov med tridnevnim dostopom, nisva mogla niti nedvoumno ugotoviti, kateri vrh je kateri. To je bil tudi glavni povod in motivacija, zakaj sva šla tja. Popoln izlet v neznano.« Po informacijah domačinov je bil nad ledenikom Khurdopin do zdaj preplezan le en nižji vrh na začetku te verige, vse drugo pa je (bilo) nedotaknjeno. Lukas Wörle med plezanjem v idealnih snežno-lednih razmerah naklona do 80 stopinj v vršnem delu karakorumskega šesttisočaka. FOTO: Aleš Česen Kakšen občutek je plezati nekje, kjer ni bilo še nikogar? »Odličen. Bistvo alpinizma je avantura. In čeprav nikoli zares ne veš, kaj točno te čaka pri naslednjem metru, je informacij o različnih gorah čedalje več in so v današnjem času tudi vse lažje dostopne. Vendar se še vedno najdejo območja, za katera je nemogoče dobiti kakšen uporaben slikovni material. In večkrat bi morali iti tudi na take cilje. Kjer ne veš dobro, kaj boš našel,« je razmišljal Česen. Raziskovanje neraziskanega so pred nedavnim začele spodbujati tudi nepalske oblasti, ki le s težavo delajo red na najvišji in najbolj zaželeni gori sveta, Mount Everestu. Ne glede na to, da zvišujejo pristojbine za pristop, se na poti na vrh še vedno vijejo kolone ljudi, med njimi so taki, ki nimajo dovolj izkušenj, kar je tudi razlog, da vsako leto štejejo smrtne žrtve. K pogojem za izdajo dovoljenj so zato Nepalci, ki so letos izdali že več kot 500 dovoljenj za pristop, dodali izkušnje: kdor želi na Everest, mora prej osvojiti vsaj enega od sedemtisočakov v Nepalu. Poleg tega so za prihodnji dve leti napovedali brezplačen dostop do97 vrhov– pri čemer upajo, da bodo pozornost usmerili na še neodkrite alpinistične cilje. Za omenjenih skoraj sto vrhov, med katerimi so številni deviški, je bilo do zdaj bore malo zanimanja; v zadnjih dveh letih se je nanje podalo le 21 odprav s skupaj 68 plezalci.",

It is already stuck in determining what is unwilling to top, as many expeditions are poorly documented (if at all), maps often lacking, which makes them difficult to find. Nevertheless, most sources, as the highest still unclear, cites the summit of Gangkhar Pensum, a 7570 -meter high mountain on the border between Butan and Tibet. The list of failures may not have seemed unexpected to the Butans, as they believe that their mountains, including the aforementioned, home deities and spirits that are not allowed to be disturbed. Photo: Wikimedia Commons also agreed with the locals and banned mountaineering over 6000 meters in 1994, and less than a decade later, this decision further reinforced and banned any mountaineering on the mountain. Five years earlier, the permit to climb the Chinese Alpine Association was given a Japanese expedition, but Butan initiated a real political dispute and achieved that it had been canceled. At least until the Butan government cancel the ban, it shows that Gangkhar Pensumostal will be Virgin Vrh, as they call unpaved mountains. The prohibition of approach due to religious beliefs is the reason that the summit is intact in several cases; Such is, for example, Mount Kailash in the NGARA prefecture in the autonomous region of Tibet in China with an altitude of 6638 meters. The sacred is in four religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Indigenous Tibetan Religion Bon. As a result, they take place there every year, and any climbing activities are prohibited. Among the reliably highest mountains, to the top of which no alpinist has already made it to the top, the Lapče Kang III with 7250 meters in Tibet in the northern Himalayas (about 35 kilometers from the much better known cho Oju). Another unpaved mountain on the border between Butan and China is Tongshanjiab (7207 meters). The real kingdom of the Virgin Mountains is also Karakorum, where one of these peaks, along with the ranking, won Aleš Česen. The huge massif lies in the regions of Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan), Ladak (India) and the Ujguric autonomous province of Šinžang (LR China). Aleš Česen discovered the unwilling world in Karakorum a little over a year ago, when he, along with the British alpinist, Livingstonoms, climbed the championship direction along the western ridge of Nagašerbrum III. Their original plan was to climb the highest mountain above the Khurdopin Sar valley (6310 meters), but they abandoned the idea due to dangerous conditions, as their plans summarized at the Alpine Association of Slovenia. The name of the championship direction was coined on the basis of the events along the way: “When we reached the base camp, we missed fresh chicken meat. The Čeririn Sar in the Karakorum no longer is one of the unpaved peaks.

Zatika se že pri določitvi, kaj je neosvojeni vrh, saj so številne odprave slabo dokumentirane (če sploh so), tudi zemljevidi pogosto pomanjkljivi, zaradi česar jih je že težko najti. Kljub temu večina virov kot najvišjega še neosvojenega navaja vrh Gangkhar Pensum, 7570 metrov visoko goro na meji med Butanom in Tibetom. Seznam neuspehov se Butancem morda niti ni zdel nepričakovan, saj verjamejo, da so njihove gore, tudi omenjena, domovanje božanstev in duhov, ki se ne pustijo motiti. FOTO: Wikimedia Commons Tudi butanska vlada se je strinjala z domačini in leta 1994 prepovedala gorništvo nad 6000 metri, slabo desetletje pozneje je to odločitev še podkrepila in prepovedala kakršenkoli alpinizem na gori. Pet let pred tem je dovoljenje za vzpon od Kitajskega alpinističnega združenja sicer dobila japonska odprava, vendar je Butan sprožil pravi politični spor in dosegel, da so ga preklicali. Vsaj dokler butanska vlada ne bo preklicala prepovedi, kaže, da bo Gangkhar Pensumostal deviški vrh, kakor imenujejo neosvojene gore. Prepoved pristopa zaradi verskih prepričanj je sicer razlog, da je vrh nedotaknjen v več primerih; takšna je, denimo, tudi gora Kailaš v prefekturi Ngari v avtonomni regiji Tibet na Kitajskem z nadmorsko višino 6638 metrov. Za sveto velja v kar štirih verah: hinduizmu, budizmu, džainizmu in avtohtoni manjšinski tibetanski religiji bon. Zaradi tega potekajo tja vsako leto romanja, kakršnekoli plezalne dejavnosti pa so prepovedane. Med zanesljivo najvišjimi gorami, na vrh katerih se še ni prebil noben alpinist, je Lapče Kang III s 7250 metri v Tibetu v severni Himalaji (približno 35 kilometrov od bistveno bolj znanega Čo Ojuja). Še ena neosvojena gora na meji med Butanom in Kitajsko je Tongshanjiabu (7207 metrov). Pravo kraljestvo deviških gora je tudi Karakorum, kjer je enega od takih vrhov skupaj s soplezalcem osvojil Aleš Česen. Ogromni masiv leži v regijah Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan), Ladak (Indija) in ujgurski avtonomni pokrajini Šindžjang (LR Kitajska). Aleš Česen je neosvojeni svet v Karakorumu odkrival že pred slabim letom dni, ko je skupaj z britanskim alpinistomTomom Livingstonomsplezal prvenstveno smer po zahodnem grebenu naGašerbrum III. Njun prvotni načrt je bil preplezati najvišjo goro nad dolino Khurdopin Sar (6310 metrov), vendar sta idejo zaradi nevarnih razmer opustila, kot so njune načrte povzeli pri Planinski zvezi Slovenije. Ime prvenstvene smeri sta skovala na podlagi pripetljajev na poti: »Ko smo dosegli bazni tabor, smo pogrešali sveže piščančje meso. Čeririn Sar v Karakorumu ne sodi več med neosvojene vrhe.

        "raw_text": "More than 300 dead after downpours in mountainous regions and several killed in Indian city of Mumbai Heavy monsoon rains have continued to pummel the Indian subcontinent over the past week, bringing devastating flooding and landslides and leaving hundreds of people dead in what has already been one of the deadliest monsoon seasons in recent years. Moist air surging inland from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea was driven intoPakistanand north-west India late last week by strong southwesterly monsoon winds. Combined with developing areas of low pressure, this triggered a succession of torrential downpours. Last Friday more than 300 people were killed after cloudbursts – episodes in which hourly rainfall exceeds 100mm – struck mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and India. In Buner district, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 150mm was recorded in just one hour. The downpours unleashed destructive flash floods that swept through valleys and villages carrying rocks and debris. More than 240 people were killed in that single event alone, making it the most catastrophic episode of the season so far. Since the onset of the monsoon in late May, Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that nearly 750 people have died. Farther south, Mumbai also endured extreme rainfall over the last week. Between 15 and 19 August, parts of the city recorded 837mm of rain – comparable to the annual average for southern England – leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. At least 21 people were killed, among them a man who was electrocuted after wading into flood waters containing a live wire. Transport was severely disrupted, with roads waterlogged, train services halted leaving hundreds stranded on platforms, and numerous flights cancelled or diverted. With the Mithi River close to bursting its banks, hundreds of residents in low-lying neighbourhoods nearby were evacuated to higher ground. Elsewhere, the heatwave that gripped much of Europe for more than a week has finally broken, replaced by severe thunderstorms. On Wednesday and Thursday about 500,000 lightning strikes were detected across the continent, most of them over southern France, Italy and the Balkans. Italy bore the brunt of the storms, which were fuelled by an area of low pressure moving in from over the unusually warm Mediterranean, allowing moist unstable air to clash with the hot air mass that had built during the heatwave. Downpours from the storms triggered landslides, uprooted trees and blocked roads, and in Sicily rivers burst their banks, sweeping away cars. One person remains missing.",

        "raw_text": "കള്ളക്കേസുകൾ ചുമത്തി മാധ്യമ പ്രവർത്തകരെ ജയിലിൽ അടയ്ക്കുകയും വായടപ്പിക്കുന്നതിന് ശ്രമിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്ന നടപടികൾ ആവർത്തിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്. ബിജെപി അധികാരത്തിലേറിയതിനുശേഷമുള്ള 11 വർഷമായി അനുസ്യൂതം ഈ പ്രക്രിയ തുടരു‍ന്നു. കേന്ദ്രസർക്കാരിന്റെ ജനവിരുദ്ധനയങ്ങളെയും ഏകപക്ഷീയവും ഏകാധിപത്യപരവുമായ നടപടികളെയും വിമർശിക്കുന്നവരെല്ലാം രാജ്യദ്രോഹികളായി മുദ്ര കുത്തപ്പെടുന്നു. സ്വതന്ത്ര മാധ്യമപ്രവർത്തനം അസാധ്യമായിരിക്കുന്നു. അതിന്റെ ഒടുവിലത്തെ ഉദാഹരണമാണ് മുതിർന്ന മാധ്യമ പ്രവർത്തകരായ സിദ്ധാർത്ഥ് വരദരാജനും കരൺ ഥാപ്പർക്കുമെതിരെ രാജ്യദ്രോഹക്കുറ്റം ചുമത്തിയുള്ള വേട്ടയാടൽ. സുപ്രീം കോടതി നിർദേശമനുസരിച്ചുള്ള സംരക്ഷണമുണ്ടായിട്ടും പുതിയ കേസെടുത്ത് നേരിട്ട് ഹാജരാകുന്നതിന് ഇരുവർക്കും അസം പൊലീസ് നോട്ടീസ് നൽകിയിരിക്കുകയാണ്. സിദ്ധാർത്ഥ് വരദരാജൻ ‘ദ വയറി’ന്റെ സ്ഥാപക പത്രാധിപരും കരൺ ഥാപ്പർ കൺസൾട്ടിങ് എഡിറ്ററുമാണ്. ഓപ്പറേഷൻ സിന്ദൂറിലെ പിഴവുകളും പഹൽഗാമിലെ സുരക്ഷാവീഴ്ചകളും സംബന്ധിച്ച് പ്രസിദ്ധീകരിച്ച വിവിധ ലേഖനങ്ങളുടെയും വാർത്തകളുടെയും പേരിലാണ് കേസെടുക്കുകയും നോട്ടീസ് നൽകുകയും ചെയ്തിട്ടുള്ളത്. സ്വാഭാവിക നടപടിക്രമങ്ങൾ ഒന്നും പാലിക്കാതെയാണ് നടപടികൾ. ഈ വർഷം മേയ് ഒമ്പത് തീയതിയായി രജിസ്റ്റർ ചെയ്ത എഫ്ഐആർ പ്രകാരമാണ് നോട്ടീസെങ്കിലും വിശദാംശങ്ങൾ ഒന്നും നൽകുന്നതിന് തയാറായില്ല. നോട്ടീസ് കിട്ടി പത്തുദിവസത്തിലധികം നിരന്തരം ബന്ധപ്പെടുകയും കഠിനപ്രയത്നം നടത്തുകയും ചെയ്ത ശേഷമാണ് എഫ്ഐആർ കാണാനായത്. നേരിട്ട് നൽകുന്നതിന് പകരം കഴിഞ്ഞ ദിവസം വെബ്സൈറ്റിൽ അപ്‌ലോഡ് ചെയ്യുകയായിരുന്നു. എഫ്ഐആർ അനുസരിച്ച് വയറിൽ പ്രസിദ്ധീകരിച്ച 12 ലേഖനങ്ങളും വാർത്തകളും അടിസ്ഥാനമാക്കിയാണ് കേസെടുത്തിട്ടുള്ളത്. ജമ്മു കശ്മീർ മുൻ ലഫ്റ്റ്നന്റ് ഗവർണർ അടുത്തിടെ അന്തരിച്ച സത്യപാൽ മാലിക്, മാധ്യമ പ്രവർത്തകനും പാകിസ്ഥാനിലെ പഞ്ചാബ് മുൻ കാവൽ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുമായ നജം സേത്തി, ദ വയർ ഹിന്ദി എഡിഷൻ പത്രാധിപർ അശുതോഷ് ഭരദ്വാജ് എന്നിവരുടെ പേരുകളും എഫ്ഐആറിൽ ഉൾപ്പെട്ടിട്ടുണ്ട്. മൊറിഗോൺ പൊലീസ് രജിസ്റ്റർ ചെയ്ത കേസിനെതിരെ നൽകിയ ഹർജി സുപ്രീം കോടതിയിൽ നിലനിൽക്കെ ക്രൈം ബ്രാഞ്ച് പൊലീസ് ദേശദ്രോഹക്കുറ്റമുൾപ്പെടെ ചുമത്തി മറ്റൊരു കേസ് കൂടി രജിസ്റ്റർ ചെയ്യുകയായിരുന്നു. പഹൽഗാം ഭീകരാക്രമണത്തിനിടയാക്കിയ സുരക്ഷാവീഴ്ചകളും ഓപ്പറേഷൻ സിന്ദൂറിലെ പോരായ്മകളും ജനസമക്ഷം തുറന്നുപറഞ്ഞതിന്റെ പേരിലാണ് ദ വയറിനെ വേട്ടയാടുന്നത്. പ്രസിദ്ധീകരിക്കപ്പെട്ട ലേഖനങ്ങളും വാർത്തകളുമാകട്ടെ പ്രമുഖരുടെ വെളിപ്പെടുത്തലുകളുടെയും വിശ്വസനീയ കേന്ദ്രങ്ങളിൽ നിന്ന് ലഭ്യമായ വിവരങ്ങളുടെയും അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലുള്ളതായിരുന്നു. അവരാരും തന്നെ അത് നിഷേധിച്ചിട്ടുമില്ല. അങ്ങനെയിരിക്കെയാണ് മാധ്യമ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തെയും ജനങ്ങളുടെ അറിയാനുള്ള അവകാശത്തെയും ചങ്ങലയ്ക്കിടുന്ന നീക്കങ്ങൾ അ സം പൊലീസിന്റെ ഭാഗത്തുനിന്നുണ്ടായിരിക്കുന്നത്. മാധ്യമ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തിന്റെ കാര്യത്തിൽ ലോകത്ത് ഇന്ത്യയുടെ സ്ഥാനം ഏറ്റവും പിന്നിൽ നിൽക്കുകയാണെന്ന് എത്രയോ റപ്പോർട്ടുകൾ ഇതിനകം പുറത്തുവന്നിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഏറ്റവും ഒടുവിൽ പുറത്തുവന്ന ലോക പത്രസ്വാതന്ത്ര്യ സൂചികയിൽ 180 രാജ്യങ്ങളിൽ 151-ാമതായിരുന്നു ഇന്ത്യയുടെ സ്ഥാനം. രാഷ്ട്രീയം, സാമ്പത്തികം, നിയമനിർമ്മാണം, സാമൂഹ്യം, സുരക്ഷ എന്നീ സൂചകങ്ങളുടെ അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലുള്ള സർവേയുടെ അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലാണ് ലോക പത്ര സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യ സൂചിക തയാറാക്കുന്നത്. പഹൽഗാം ഭീകരാക്രമണത്തിന് പിന്നാലെ നടത്തിയ ഓപ്പറേഷൻ സിന്ദൂറുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ട വാർത്തകൾ നൽകിയതിന്റെ പേരിൽ ഇരുപതോളം ഓൺലൈൻ മാധ്യമങ്ങളെ വിലക്കുകയും എണ്ണൂറോളം എക്സ് അക്കൗണ്ടുകൾ മരവിപ്പിക്കാൻ ആവശ്യപ്പെടുകയും ചെയ്ത നടപടികളുമുണ്ടായി. ബിജെപി ഭരണത്തിനുകീഴിൽ മാധ്യമ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യം എത്രത്തോളം അപകടകരമായി എന്നതിന് ഇവയ്ക്കെല്ലാം പുറമേ നൂറുകണക്കിന് ഉദാഹരണങ്ങൾ വേറെയുമുണ്ട്. സിദ്ദീഖ് കാപ്പനെന്ന മലയാളി മാധ്യമ പ്രവർത്തകന്റെ നീണ്ട കാലത്തെ ജയിൽവാസം, ന്യൂസ് ക്ലിക്കിനും അതിന്റെ മേധാവികൾക്കുമെതിരായ കേസും ജയിൽവാസവും എന്നിവ അതിൽ ചിലതുമാത്രമാണ്. ഡൽഹി കലാപം റിപ്പോർട്ട് ചെയ്ത മലയാള ദൃശ്യമാധ്യമങ്ങളായ ഏഷ്യാനെറ്റ്, മീഡിയ വൺ എന്നിവയ്ക്ക് നിരോധനമേർപ്പെടുത്തിയതും മാധ്യമ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തിനെതിരായ നീക്കം തന്നെയായിരുന്നു. സ്വേച്ഛാധിപത്യവും അധികാര ധിക്കാരവും അഹങ്കാരവും അലങ്കാരമാക്കുന്ന എല്ലാ ഭരണാധികാരികളും മാധ്യമ വിലക്ക് ദിനചര്യയെന്നതുപോലെ സ്വീകരിക്കാറുണ്ട്. പലസ്തീനെതിരായ യുദ്ധത്തിന്റെ കെടുതികളും ഗാസയിലെ ജനങ്ങളെ പട്ടിണിക്കിട്ട് കൊല്ലുന്നതിന്റെ തീവ്ര വേദനകളും ലോകസമക്ഷമെത്തിച്ച മാധ്യമ പ്രവർത്തകരെ കൊല്ലുന്ന രീതിയാണ് ഇസ്രയേൽ ഭരണകൂടം നടത്തുന്നത്. അതേ രീതിതന്നെ ഇവിടെ നരേന്ദ്ര മോഡിയുടെ നേതൃത്വത്തിലുള്ള കേന്ദ്രസർക്കാരും വിവിധ സംസ്ഥാന ബിജെപി സർക്കാരുകളും പിന്തുടരുന്നു. ജനാധിപത്യ സംവിധാനത്തിന്റെ നാലാം തൂണും ദ്രവിപ്പിച്ച് ഇല്ലാതാക്കുകയെന്നത് വഴിവിട്ട മാർഗങ്ങളിലൂടെ നിലനിൽപിന് ശ്രമിക്കുന്ന ബിജെപി-ആർഎസ്എസ് കൂട്ടുകെട്ടിന് അനിവാര്യമാണ്. അതിന്റെ തുടർക്കഥകളാണ് നാം വായിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നത്. മധ്യമങ്ങൾ കൂടി ഇല്ലാതാകുമ്പോൾ പൂർണമായും ഇരുട്ടിലെത്തുകയാണ് നമ്മളെന്ന് തിരിച്ചറിഞ്ഞുള്ള പ്രതിരോധങ്ങൾ ഉണ്ടാകുന്നില്ലെങ്കിൽ നമ്മെത്തന്നെയാണ് നമുക്ക് നഷ്ടമാകുക. ഇവിടെ പോസ്റ്റു ചെയ്യുന്ന അഭിപ്രായങ്ങള്‍ ജനയുഗം പബ്ലിക്കേഷന്റേതല്ല. അഭിപ്രായങ്ങളുടെ പൂര്‍ണ ഉത്തരവാദിത്തം പോസ്റ്റ് ചെയ്ത വ്യക്തിക്കായിരിക്കും. കേന്ദ്ര സര്‍ക്കാരിന്റെ ഐടി നയപ്രകാരം വ്യക്തി, സമുദായം, മതം, രാജ്യം എന്നിവയ്‌ക്കെതിരായി അധിക്ഷേപങ്ങളും അശ്ലീല പദപ്രയോഗങ്ങളും നടത്തുന്നത് ശിക്ഷാര്‍ഹമായ കുറ്റമാണ്. ഇത്തരം അഭിപ്രായ പ്രകടനത്തിന് ഐടി നയപ്രകാരം നിയമനടപടി കൈക്കൊള്ളുന്നതാണ്.",

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings. Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here. Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you). Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities. Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests. Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests. Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns. Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you. Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents). Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers. Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you). Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them. Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device. The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices. Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice. In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices). Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice. With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice. The choices you make with this CMP regarding the purposes and entities will affect how personalized advertising is presented to you. We need to store these choices to respect them on future visits, and they are stored differently based on the type of site or app you're using: * For , your choices are saved in device storage prefixed by “IABTCF_”. Your choices will be invalidated after 390 days and overwritten once you make new privacy choices on this app. * For , your choices are saved in local storage prefixed by “amp-store”.

        "description": "Your captain is still standing tall : Imran Khan after getting bail in May 9 violence cases - World News",
        "raw_text": "Pakistan‘s Supreme Court on Thursday granted bail to incarcerated former prime ministerImran Khanin eight cases related to the May 9 violence. Khan’s supporters resorted to vandalism and violence on May 9, 2023, after he was detained by law enforcement authorities in Islamabad. Several cases were launched against Khan and leaders of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party for their alleged role in the riots. A three-member bench of the apex court, led by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi, granted Khan bail after hearing the arguments by his lawyer Salman Safdar, and Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi, who represented the state. The 72-year-old cricketer-turned-politician in a social media post after the verdict said the end of this night of oppression in his country is near. “My message to the entire nation, to my workers and to the party leadership is that your captain is still standing tall with his head held high. Have no fear,” Khan said. “We must not, under any circumstances, bow our heads down before tyranny and oppression. Remember — no matter how long and dark the night may be, dawn is certain to break. The end of this night of oppression is near. God willing, the sun of justice and freedom will soon rise,” he said. Khan’s PTI hailed the ruling, using the hashtag “Victory For Imran Khan” in its post on X, while its international spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said the party supremo now needed bail in just one case. “Supreme Court has granted bail to Imran Khan for May 9th cases, now bail is needed for just one more case (Al Qadir case) for Mr Khan to come out of jail,” he said. Bukhari said Khan would not be released despite the latest relief due to his conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Khan had filed a petition for bail in a Lahore anti-terrorism court in the cases related to the May 9 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander, but it was rejected in November 2024. He challenged it in the Lahore High Court, but it also rejected the plea on June 24 this year. Following this, Khan challenged the dismissal of the bail plea before the top court. The former premier has been facing multiple other cases filed against him after his removal from office in April 2022. He has been imprisoned since August 2023 and is currently serving a sentence at Rawalpindi’s high-security Adiala Jail in the 190 million pounds Al-Qadir graft case. Retirement planning has evolved from relying on traditional methods like fixed deposits and pensions to a more diverse and self-sufficient approach due to inflation, rising healthcare costs, and lower returns. It is crucial to unlearn old strategies and prioritize flexibility and maintaining one’s lifestyle for a longer retirement period.",

        "raw_text": "प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी आज कोलकाता के दौरे पर हैं। PM ने यहां 5200 करोड़ रुपए की परियोजनाओं का उद्घाटन और शिलान्यास किया। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने कुल 13.62 किलोमीटर लंबे तीन नए रूट का उद्घाटन किया। इसके अलावा PM ने 1200 करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा की लागत से बनने वाले 6 लेन कोना एक्सप्रेसवे की आधारशिला रखी। यह एक्सप्रेसवे 7.2 किलोमीटर लंबा होगा। राज्य की मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी कार्यक्रम में शामिल नहीं हुई हैं। इसके बाद जनसभा में PM मोदी ने कहा- भारत सरकार ने घुसपैठियों के खिलाफ अभियान चलाया है। TMC, कांग्रेस समेत INDI अलायंस सत्ता के लिए घुसपैठ को बढ़ावा दे रहा है। विकसित देशों में घुसपैठियों के खिलाफ मुहिम चल रही है। भारत भी घुसपैठियों को ज्यादा नहीं सह सकता है। आपका एक वोट बंगाल को घुसपैठियों से मुक्त करा सकता है। 30 दिन तक जेल में रहने पर PM, CM और मंत्रियों को पद से हटाने का कानून बनाने वाले बिल पर PM ने कहा मुख्यमंत्री तक जेल से सरकार चलाते हैं। ये संविधान और लोकतंत्र का अपमान है। इसके अलावा प्रधानमंत्री ने TMC सरकार, भ्रष्टाचार और ऑपरेशन सिंदूर पर भी बात की। कार्यक्रम की 2 फोटो... PM मोदी के भाषण की 4 बड़ी बातें... 1. TMC सरकार:बंगाल को नई रोशनी की जरूरत है। यहां आजादी के बाद पहले कांग्रेस और कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी का लंबा दौरा देखा है। आज क्राइम और करप्शन TMC सरकार की पहचान बन गई। बंगाल कह रहा है TMC जाएगी तभी असली बदलाव आएगा। बंगाल को सत्ता परिवर्तन चाहिए, ऐसा परिवर्तन जहां सुशासन होगा। ये परिवर्तन सिर्फ भाजपा ला सकती है। TMC विकास की दुश्मन है। TMC सरकार ने स्मार्ट सिटी मिशन से जुड़ने से इनकार कर दिया। TMC का मिशन भाजपा को रोकना है। 2. ऑपरेशन सिंदूर:ऑपरेशन सिंदूर में हमारी सेना ने सीमा पार आतंकियों और आतंक के आकाओं के अड्डों को खंडहर में बदल दिया। ऐसा सबक सिखाया कि पाकिस्तान की आज भी नींद उड़ी हुई है। सेना को ताकत देने में बंगाल का बहुत योगदान है। गुलामी के दौर में इच्छापुर में डिफेंस मेन्युफैक्चरिंग का काम शुरू हुआ। कांग्रेस सरकार ने इस इंडस्ट्री को बर्बाद कर दिया। सेना को विदेश पर निर्भर कर दिया। 3. घुसपैठ:भारत सरकार ने घुसपैठियों के खिलाफ अभियान चलाया है। जो लोग हमारे युवाओं को रोजगार छीन रहे हैं, इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर दबाव बना रहे हैं, बहन-बेटियों पर अत्याचार कर रहे हैं ऐसे घुसपैठियों को भारत में रहने नहीं देंगे। 4. एंटी करप्शन बिल:सरकार लोकसभा में एंटी करप्शन बिल लाई है। हमारे देश में किसी भी कर्मचारी को यदि पुलिस पकड़कर जेल में डालती है तो उसकी नौकरी चली जाती है। कोई मुख्यमंत्री, मंत्री, प्रधानमंत्री जेल चला जाए तो उसके लिए कानून नहीं है। हालत तो देखिए आजकल ये लोग इतने गिरे हैं कि जेल से भी सरकार चलाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। TMC का मंत्री शिक्षक भर्ती में आज तक जेल में है, तब भी वो कुर्सी छोड़ने को तैयार नहीं थे। TMC के एक और मंत्री पर गरीबों के राशन लूटने का आरोप है। ये भी जेल जाने के बाद कुर्सी छोड़ने को तैयार नहीं थे। CM तक जेल से सरकार चलाते हैं। ये संविधान और लोकतंत्र का अपमान है। प्रधानमंत्री के कार्यक्रम और भाषण से जुड़े सभी अपडेट्स के लिए ब्लॉग से गुजर जाएं... PM ने कहा- बंगाल की विरासत विकसित बंगाल बनाने की प्रेरणा देगी। हमें बांग्ला को शास्त्रीय भाषा का दर्जा देने का मौका मिला। जब भाजपा सरकार बनेगी तो हेरिटेज टूरिज्म को बढ़ावा देने का प्लान है। गंगा जी पर इनलैंड वाटर वे बना रहे हैं ताकि बंगाल के नौजवानों को काम के लिए कहीं और जाने की जरूरत न पड़े। समुद्र में भी टूरिज्म की संभावनाएं हैं। उन्होंने कहा- बंगाल के लोग समय से आगे की सोचते हैं। आजकल जिन देशों को विकसित कहा जाता है, वहां घुसपैठियों के खिलाफ मुहिम चल रही है। भारत भी घुसपैठियों को ज्यादा नहीं सह सकता है। घुसपैठियों से बंगाल को आपका एक वोट मुक्त करा सकता है। प्रधानमंत्री ने कहा कि भाजपा के पास बंगाल के विकास का रोडमैप है लेकिन TMC विकास की दुश्मन है। दमदम कोलकाता के सबसे भीड़ वाला इलाका है लेकिन इसकी स्थिति क्या है, आप जानते हैं। ऐसे शहरी क्षेत्रों के विकास के लिए स्मार्ट सिटी मिशन चल रहा है लेकिन TMC सरकार ने इससे जुड़ने से इनकार कर दिया। PM मोदी ने कहा- TMC का मिशन भाजपा को रोकना है। केंद्र की योजनाओं को रोकना है। मैं बंगाल के लोगों से पूछता हूं क्या ये तरीका सही है, क्या इस राजनीति से बंगाल का भला होगा? भाजपा आएगी तो रेल और मेट्रो का तेजी से विकास होगा। इलेक्ट्रिक व्हीकल इंडस्ट्री बनेगी। ये तभी होगा जब भ्रष्टाचार पर लगाम लगेगी और बंगाल में डबल इंजन की सरकार होगी। PM मोदी ने कहा- ऑपरेशन सिंदूर में हमारी सेना ने सीमा पार आतंकियों और आतंक के आकाओं के अड्डों को खंडहर में बदल दिया। आतंकियों को ऐसा सबक सिखाया कि पाकिस्तान की आज भी नींद उड़ी हुई है। सेना को ताकत देने में बंगाल की भूमि का बहुत बड़ा योगदान है। इच्छापुर में गुलामी के दौर में डिफेंस मेन्युफैक्चरिंग का काम शुरू हुआ लेकिन कांग्रेस सरकार ने इस इंडस्ट्री को बर्बाद कर दिया। सेना को विदेश पर निर्भर कर दिया। उन्होंने कहा- भाजपा सरकार ने डिफेंस सरकार को मजबूती दी। इच्छापुर में बनी फैक्ट्री से यहां छोटे-छोटे उद्योगों के लिए अवसर बने। इस फैक्ट्री के कारण हजारों लोगों को रोजगार मिला। आप 2026 में भाजपा की सरकार बनाइए। बंगाल को डॉ मुखर्जी के सपनों का बंगाल में बनाएंगे। बंद पड़े कारखाने फिर से खुलेंगे। दमदम फिर से इंडस्ट्रियल हब बनेगा। ये भाजपा का संकल्प है। यह साल डॉ श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी की जयंती का 125वां वर्ष है। भाजपा का जन्म डॉ मुखर्जी के आशीर्वाद से हुआ। वे औद्योगिक विकास के जनक रहे लेकिन कांग्रेस ने कभी उन्हें श्रेय नहीं दिया। उन्होंने पहले उद्योग मंत्री के रूप में पहली इंडस्ट्री बनाई थी। हम उस नीति पर चलते तो देश की तस्वीर कुछ और होती। फिर कुछ ऐसा हुआ कि हम विदेश पर निर्भर हो गए। जो सपने डॉ मुखर्जी ने देखे थे उसके लिए हम अपना जीवन खपा रहे हैं। बंगाल के लोग जानते हैं कि दूसरों पर निर्भरता आत्मसम्मान पर चोट है। इसी स्थिति से हमें देश को बाहर निकालना है। देश ने आज आत्मनिर्भरता का मूल मंत्र लेकर नई ऊंचाइयां पाने का फैसला लिया है। PM ने कहा- 21वीं सदी के 25 साल तो बीत गए। आने वाले साल बंगाल के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है। बंगाल को सत्ता परिवर्तन चाहिए। परिवर्तन काम में दिखे, परिवर्तन जो उद्योग लगाएं और बेटे-बेटियों को नौकरी दे। परिवर्तन जो किसान को सुविधा दे, परिवर्तन लोगों को घर जलने से बचाए, परिवर्तन जहां अधिकारी और सत्ताधारी सरकार में नहीं जेल में होंगे। ऐसा परिवर्तन जहां सुशासन होगा। ये परिवर्तन सिर्फ भाजपा ला सकती है। आज बंगाल को नई रोशनी की जरूरत है। यहां आजादी के बाद पहले कांग्रेस और कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी का लंबा दौरा देखा है। 15 साल पहले परिवर्तन का फैसला लिया लेकिन भर्ती घोटालों से नौजवानों का भविष्य खराब हुआ, बहनों पर अत्याचार बढ़ा, आज क्राइम करप्शन TMC सरकार की पहचान बढ़ गई। जब तक TMC की सरकार रहेगी, तब तक बंगाल का विकास नहीं होगा। बंगाल का जन जन कह रहा है TMC जाएगी तभी असली बदलाव आएगा। प्रधानमंत्री ने जनसभा में कहा- मैं ऐसे समय में कोलकाता आया हूं जब दुर्गापूजा की तैयारियां शुरू हो गई हैं। बड़ा बाजार से पार्क स्ट्रीट तक कोलकाता नए रंग में सज रहा है। जब आस्था और आनंद के साथ विकास का पर्व जुड़ता है तो खुशी दोगुनी हो जाती है। पश्चिम बंगाल आबादी के लिहाज से सबसे बड़े राज्यों में से है। जब तक बंगाल का सामर्थ्य नहीं बढ़ेगा तब तक विकसित भारत की यात्रा सफल नहीं हो पाएगी। बीते 11 साल में केंद्र की भाजपा सरकार ने बंगाल के विकास के लिए लगातार हर प्रकार की मदद की है। PM मोदी ने कहा- भारत में दुनिया का तीसरा सबसे बड़ा मेट्रो रेल नेटवर्क है। 2014 से पहले देश में 250 किलोमीटर का मेट्रो रूट था जो कि आज 1000 किलोमीटर से ज्यादा का हो गया। एक शहर से दूसरे शहर तक लोगों को पहुंचाने के साथ हमारी कोशिश है कि लोगों को सीधे घर तक ट्रांसपोर्ट मिले। ईस्टर्न रेलवे से ट्रेन पकड़ने के लिए समय लगता था लेकिन हावड़ा सव बे बनने के बाद कम समय लगेगा। आज से कोलकाता मेट्रो भी एयरपोर्ट से जुड़ गया है। बंगाल के अलग अलग रूट पर 9 वंदे भारत ट्रेन और 2 अमृत भारत ट्रेन चल रही हैं। जब 6 लेन कोना एक्सप्रेस वे बनकर तैयार हो जाएगी तो इससे पोर्ट की कनेक्टिविटी भी बेहतर हो जाएगी। PM मोदी ने कार्यक्रम में कहा कि कोलकाता का पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट आधुनिक हो रहा है। आज 6 लेन कोना एक्सप्रेसवे का शिलान्यास किया गया। कोलकाता जैसे हमारे शहर भारत के इतिहास और भविष्य दोनों की पहचान है। भारत दुनिया की तीसरी सबसे बड़ी इकोनॉमी बनने वाली है तो दमदम कोलकाता जैसे शहरों की भूमिका बहुत बड़ी है। आज का भारत अपने शहरों का कैसे कायाकल्प कर रहा है। ग्रीन मोबलिटी, इलेक्ट्रानिक चार्जिंग, मेट्रो की सुविधा बढ़ रही है। PM मोदी ने 18 जुलाई को दुर्गापुर में 5000 करोड़ रुपए से ज्यादा की लागत वाली परियोजनाओं का शिलान्यास और उद्घाटन किया था। इसमें ऑयल, गैस, बिजली, सड़क और रेल से जुड़ी कई अन्य विकास परियोजनाएं शामिल थीं। इस दौरान मोदी ने कहा था कि बंगाल में TMC ने अपने स्वार्थ के लिए घुसपैठ को बढ़ावा दिया। इसके लिए इकोसिस्टम बनाया जा रहा है। ये राज्य-देश और बांग्ला संस्कृति के लिए खतरा है। TMC ने घुसपैठियों के पक्ष में नई मुहिम शुरू की। मोदी ने कहा- 'मैं साफ कहता हूं- जो भारत का नागरिक नहीं है और घुसपैठ करके आया है, उसपर संविधान के तहत कार्रवाई होकर रहेगी। बंगाल के खिलाफ साजिश को भाजपा कामयाब नहीं होने देगी, ये मोदी की गारंटी है।'पूरी खबर पढ़ें... पीएम मोदी ने 29 मई को पश्चिम बंगाल के अलीपुरद्वार में कहा था, 'पाकिस्तान समझ ले 3 बार घर में घुसकर मारा है। हम शक्ति को पूजने वाले लोग हैं। बंगाल टाइगर की धरती से 140 करोड़ भारतीयों का ऐलान है कि ऑपरेशन सिंदूर अभी खत्म नहीं हुआ है।' राज्य की सत्ताधारी पार्टी TMC पर निशाना साधते हुए मोदी ने कहा था कि केंद्र की बीजेपी सरकार देशभर में गरीबों को पक्के घर दे रही लेकिन यहां लाखों परिवारों का घर नहीं बन पा रहा है क्योंकि टीमएसी के लोग इसमें भी गरीब के पास से कट और कमीशन की मांग कर रहे हैं।पूरी खबर पढ़ें... पश्चिम बंगाल की मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी ने 29 मई को कोलकाता में प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी पर विवादित टिप्पणी की। उन्होंने कहा कि पीएम मोदी ऐसे बात कर रहे हैं, जैसे हर महिला के पति हों। वे अपनी पत्नी को सिंदूर क्यों नहीं देते? हालांकि मैं इस संबंध में बात नहीं करना चाहती, लेकिन आपने मुझे बोलने के लिए मजबूर कर दिया।पूरी खबर पढ़ें...

        "raw_text": "China will have to do more to persuade India that its overtures are substantive. Comments in the Chinese media suggest deep scepticism about India’s China policy. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) There is little doubt that the Donald Trump factor has complicated the geopolitical context in which India pursues its complex relations with China. Serious questions have surfaced about India’s strategic relationship with the US as Trump has underplayed Delhi’s geopolitical relevance and sent out negative signals on issues ranging from tariffs to Pakistan to sourcing of oil from Russia. Compared to the first Trump term, when the US shifted to defining China as a “strategic competitor,” the second Trump administration’s strategy is far less coherent. The Chinese believe that they have stared down the US in their tussle on trade, tariff and export controls. Trump’s pursuit of a “beautiful deal” with China prioritises short-term economic gains over strategic clarity. The two countries are engaged in a serious dialogue, which could culminate in Trump’s visit to China later this year. Yet, China remains convinced that the US is seeking to slow down its rise. In this environment, India and China are seeking more space with a relative thaw in their fraught relations. Yet, the India-China relationship has its own drivers and dynamics that will largely determine its future trajectory. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to India offers guarded optimism but no reset. The Wang Yi visit produced a 10-point understanding, including resuming direct flights and reopening three border trade points. Steps have been taken to reboot discussions on border-related differences, along with progress towards rebuilding a damaged relationship, a process that commenced at PM ’s meeting with President Xi Jinping at Kazan in October last year. To what extent this two-track approach will yield substantive outcomes will depend largely on how serious China is about addressing India’s concerns. The evidence so far suggests a tactical outreach by China without accommodating India’s interests and sensitivities. After Chinese transgressions in eastern Ladakh, the border issue has returned to the centre-stage. The business of disengagement is still unfinished as there are continuing restrictions on patrolling by Indian troops and the grazing activities of Indian herdsmen in areas they traditionally visited in “buffer zones”. The de-escalation process has not made much headway, but now the two sides have agreed to “discuss de-escalation, beginning with the principles and modalities thereof.” While structural challenges in the relationship remain unresolved, some of the old concerns have acquired more ominous overtones. The most alarming development is the recent China-Pakistan battlefield collusion, vividly demonstrated during Operation Sindoor in May 2025. China’s support went well beyond diplomatic support and deployment of advanced weaponry provided by it. There was close operational support with credible reports about the provision of real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), integrating command-and-control systems and advisory inputs, creating an extended theatre with China’s involvement without its explicit military engagement. We do not know whether this matter was broached with Wang Yi. China has started construction of a massive hydropower project, thrice the size of the largest hydropower project in the world (Three Gorges), without considering the interests of the lower riparian, India. This issue was raised forcefully by the Indian side without getting much satisfaction. In recent months, we have seen China denying supplies of rare-earth magnets, specialised fertilisers and tunnel boring machines, and being asked to withdraw several hundred Chinese technicians from factories in India. This issue was also taken up with the Chinese FM, and while there might be some easing of supplies, the weaponisation of India’s dependencies on China will not change. As the PM told Wang Yi, India seeks stable, predictable and constructive relations with China. However, this objective will have to be pursued in a realistic manner, without overlooking unpalatable facts in engagements with China. China will have to do more to persuade India that its overtures are substantive and not merely cosmetic. Comments in the Chinese media suggest deep scepticism about India’s China policy. The perceived softening of India’s stance is seen as a sign of weakness, stemming from turbulence in its relations with the US. China sees its own pressure points here. Thus, Chinese readouts on Wang Yi’s meetings with the Minister of External Affairs and National Security Adviser cited them as giving assurances on Taiwan being part of China and on the “One-China Policy”. The Ministry of External Affairs was constrained to clarify that there was no change in India’s position. In another effort to exploit India’s predicament vis-à-vis the US, the Chinese readout on Wang Yi’s meeting with the Prime Minister claimed India joined China in opposing “unilateral bullying”, a barely disguised reference to America. The bottom line is that the answer to India’s anxieties with the US does not lie in making common cause with China, which remains its primary strategic challenge with a serious deficit of convergent interests. Unless the facts on the ground change, the process of normalisation with China should be carefully calibrated and a reset in ties is not a realistic proposition at present. Expectations from the PM’s forthcoming visit to Tianjin, China should be moderated accordingly.",

        "raw_text": "As part of a broader strategy to crack down on terrorism, the Jammu and Kashmir Police have intensified action against terrorists, including those operating from Pakistan, by attaching dozens of movable and immovable properties across the Union Territory. Officials say the move is aimed at ensuring terrorists pay a heavy price for their actions and to send a strong message that no anti-national activity would be tolerated. In recent months, police have expanded their crackdown not only on active terrorists within the region but also on those based across the border. Properties belonging to several such individuals have been seized. In the latest action this week, Srinagar police announced the attachment of orchard land worth approximately Rs 1 crore located in Bandi Payeen, Baramulla district. The property belongs to Asif Maqbool Dar, a designated terrorist by the Union Home Ministry, who is currently residing in Pakistan. Similarly, in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, police attached immovable property belonging to active terrorist Adil Hussain Thoker. Over the past several months, dozens of properties have been attached across both Kashmir and Jammu region. Police have also taken action against individuals found to be sheltering militants. The crackdown is not confined to the Kashmir Valley. Several districts in the Jammu region have witnessed similar action with police attaching the properties of militants based in Pakistan or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), who are involved in orchestrating militancy-related activities from across the border. Sending clear message A senior police officer told The Tribune that these measures are part of efforts to increase the cost of militancy. “We want to send a clear message that becoming a militant is no longer easy—it comes with serious consequences, not just for the individual but for their family as well,” said a police officer from south Kashmir. “This approach has helped bring down local recruitment to an all-time low as people now understand the full implications of joining militancy.” Officials also stressed that targeting the financial networks of militants is critical as finances are the backbone of any insurgency. “By attaching properties and seizing assets, we’ve managed to disrupt their financial operations,” the officer said. “In some cases, this has even helped prevent planned attacks.” Careful consideration Some officials, however, insist that all such actions are carried out after careful consideration of the legal and social implications. Following the Pahalgam attack in April, security forces demolished several houses linked to militants. However, these demolitions were later halted amid rising public resentment in the Valley. “Any action perceived as illegal or excessive can create disaffection among the public, and that’s the last thing we want,” said a Valley-based officer. “So, every move is weighed against its potential unintended consequences.” In a similar vein, the Union Territory has recently launched an intensified campaign against drug peddlers, mirroring its crackdown on terrorism.

        "raw_text": "Pakistan’s Punjab police on Friday confirmed that incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan has been arrested in connection with May 9, 2023 riots cases and not abducted as claimed. Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in a statement on Thursday claimed that Shahrez Khan was abducted from his home here. “Punjab police have arrested Shahrez Khan. He was wanted in connection with the May 9 cases and will be produced before a court today,” DIG Investigation Zeeshan Raza said in a statement. “Those involved in anti-state activities do not deserve any leniency,” he said. ’s close aide Zulfi Bokhari late on Thursday night said, “Cowards in civilian clothing attacked Aleema Khanum’s (Imran’s sister) house. They beat up the poor staff and abducted her son Shahrez Khan, who has nothing to do with politics.” “These are new lows of brutal fascism. We strongly condemn this appalling act. Disgraceful cowards,” he said. “Shahrez Khan, who is an international athlete, was abducted from his bedroom after breaking the doors of the house — the servants were subjected to brutal violence and Shahrez Khan was tortured in front of his two innocent children after forcibly entering the room,” the PTI said. Earlier, she had told the media that Imran Khan asked his party members to hold Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir accountable if anything happens to him in jail. Ali Amin Gandapur, a senior PTI leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, took to X to condemn the incident and demanded Sharez’s immediate release. “The abduction of Aleema Khan’s son Shahrez from her home by men in plain clothes is despicable,” he lambasted. Shahrez graduated from Oxford University and at present, he works as the regional head at Simba Global, a big linen supplier based in Australia and is also a triathlete. Imran Khan’s other nephew Hassan Niazi is convicted by the military court in case related to May 9, 2023, when Khan’s party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad, some 130 kms from Lahore. A senior Finance Ministry official, Navjot Singh, died in an accident involving a BMW M5 and his bike. His father, Balwant Singh, is heartbroken and blames the hospital for his son's death. Navjot was a beloved and accomplished government official, leaving behind a void in the lives of his family and colleagues. His son's birthday has now become a day of mourning.

        "raw_text": "The Russian analyst highlights how US tariffs and engagement with Pakistan have inadvertently strengthened Moscow and New Delhi's strategic and economic ties In the wake of Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit to Moscow and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Russian analyst has stated that the US’s traditional India policy of ‘carrot-and-stick’ flopped this time. He added that US President Donald Trump’s 50 per cent tariff policy on India “played into the hands of Russia, bringing India and Russia closer.” Boris Volkhonsky, associate professor at the Institute of Asian and African Studies at Moscow State University, told Russian media organisationURA.RUthat Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with Jaishankar on Thursday was a response to Trump's tariffs. “Putin has turned the ultimatums of Trump in Russia's favor. The trade war that the United States has unleashed against India is contributing to a closer rapprochement between Moscow and New Delhi,” Volkhonsky said. 🇷🇺🇮🇳 President of Russia Vladimir#Putinmet in the Kremlin with Minister of External Affairs of India@DrSJaishankar. The Jaishankar-Putin meeting also comes amid the latter’s planned visit to India before the end of the year. Also read: Amid Trump tariffs, Russia woos India; Jaishankar hails 'steadiest' ties since World War II A day before the meeting, reports said India was resuming the purchase of Russian oil in September-October amid widened discounts. State-run refineries, IOC, and BPCL had halted the purchases due to narrow discounts and after Trump’s tariff threats. “India is a country that puts its eggs in different baskets. Therefore, it will look at the actions of different political players. The fact that Trump is flirting with Pakistan in order to tear it away from China has also caused discontent in New Delhi. The Indians are very jealous of other countries getting closer to Pakistan. This also applies to the United States, which wants to bring Pakistan back into its orbit,” Volkhonsky explained. Against this background, Volkhonsky said, Russia and India will continue to draw closer and develop new mechanisms of interaction. “This extends to not only bilateral relations, but also ties with other countries within the BRICS and SCO, of which both countries are members, since members of these organisations are also subject to pressure from the United States,” he said. \"The hegemony of the West is coming to an end, and it is necessary to develop new mechanisms of interaction. The US has always used a carrot and stick policy (or, in English, a carrot and a stick) towards India. Now, Trump has tried to use this policy again, but it did not work. And this only brings Russia and India, and India and China, closer together. And it plays into our hands,\" the political scientist said. India had stated that Jaishankar and Putin were discussing transport, logistics, banking, and financial partnership that would be immune to external pressures. On its part, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the relations between the two countries were among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world since the Second World War. \"Geo-political convergence, leadership contacts and popular sentiment remain its key drivers,\" he said.

        "raw_text": "With the MHA asserting that nominating five members to Jammu and Kashmir’s assembly is the sole prerogative of the Lt Governor, a new ‘disempowerment’ challenge has emerged for the political class of the erstwhile state, reportsMasood Hussain A legal and political storm is brewingin Jammu and Kashmir after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) filed an affidavit in the High Court asserting the Lt Governor’s (LG) discretionary power to nominate five members to the Legislative Assembly without the “aid and advice” of the elected government. The MHA’s stance, which it claims is a statutory function to ensure inclusivity and representation, has been met with fierce opposition from political parties across the spectrum, including the ruling National Conference (NC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The MHA’s affidavit was filed in response to a plea by senior Congress leader Ravinder Sharma, who has challenged the constitutional validity of Sections 15, 15-A, and 15-B of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. These sections empower the LG to nominate five members: two women, two representatives from the Kashmiri migrant community (one of whom must be a woman), and one member from the persons displaced from the part of Kashmir on the other side of the LoC, officially called Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The total strength of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, including these nominated members, stands at 95, with 90 elected seats. An additional 24 seats are reserved for areas under PoJK. Sharma’s petition argues that these provisions are unconstitutional and have the potential to “turn a minority into a majority, or a majority into a minority,” thereby violating the basic structure of the Constitution. He contends that the nominations are “over and above the sanctioned strength of 114” and that the LG should not be able to act without the council of ministers’ advice. Sharma, represented by senior Supreme Court lawyer Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, has announced his intention to file a rejoinder to the MHA’s reply before the next hearing, scheduled for August 14. The MHA, in its affidavit, has sought to dismiss Sharma’s plea, labelling it “politically motivated.” It argues that the LG’s power to nominate is a statutory function, distinct from the executive authority that requires the council of ministers’ advice. The MHA’s position is that this is in line with the governance model of other Union Territories like Delhi and Puducherry. The ministry emphasised that the sections were enacted to serve a “critical legislative function” by ensuring representation for under-represented communities and historically displaced persons. This, they assert, is necessary because “women are not adequately represented in the legislative assembly,” and displaced communities like Kashmiri migrants and PoJK residents lack a voice in the governance structure. Fierce Reaction This legal battle has ignited a political firestorm, with Jammu and Kashmir’s mainstream parties uniting in their criticism of the Centre’s position. Former Chief Minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti took toX(formerly Twitter) to denounce the decision as a “blatant subversion of democratic principles.” She argued that “nowhere else in the country does the Centre handpick legislators to override the public mandate” and that in a “Muslim-majority region, long marred by conflict,” this move feels “less like governance and more like control.” Mufti also urged the Omar Abdullah-led government to challenge the “undemocratic precedent,” stating that “silence now would be complicity later.” Echoing her sentiments, National Conference chief spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq called the move “contempt for the people’s mandate.” He posted onXthat with an elected government holding an “absolute majority,” bypassing it to allow the LG to “handpick members” strikes at the heart of parliamentary democracy, and sets a “dangerous precedent.” CPI(M) leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami also joined the chorus of criticism, calling the MHA’s justification a “clear attempt to undermine the electoral democratic process.” He pointed out that the LG is an “unelected nominee” and giving him the authority to nominate members “runs contrary to the very spirit of representative democracy.” High-Stakes Intervention The political stakes are high, with the MHA’s decision having the potential to significantly alter the balance of power in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and even influence elections for the Rajya Sabha. The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly has 90 elected members, and an alliance between the NC and Congress, holding over 50 seats, is in a strong position. With the five LG-nominated members, the total strength of the house would increase to 95. While the current alliance has a comfortable majority, the BJP could potentially use the five nominated votes to increase its strength in the assembly and aim for an additional Rajya Sabha seat, bringing its potential total from one to two of the four available seats. This could have a substantial impact on the political landscape of the Union Territory, which has been without Rajya Sabha members since February 2021. The outcome of the High Court case is therefore not just a legal matter but a crucial political one. The court’s decision on whether Sections 15, 15-A, and 15-B of the Reorganisation Act violate the basic structure of the Constitution will determine the future of legislative representation and the balance of power in Jammu and Kashmir. For now, the fate of the five nominated members and the political equilibrium of the UT hang in suspense as the legal battle unfolds. Earlier System Before Jammu and Kashmir’s reorganisation, the erstwhile state’s assembly consisted of 87 seats available for contestation, a figure derived from an initial strength of 111 seats with 24 officially reserved for areas under Pakistani control. This pre-2019 seat allocation saw the Kashmir valley holding the largest share with 46 seats, followed by the Jammu region with 37, and the Ladakh region with 4. Routinely, the ruling party would nominate two women to the house, but they would lack voting rights. This bicameral system, which included a legislative council, was dissolved in late 2018, with the 13th assembly being elected in 2024 under the new unicameral structure established by the 2019 Act. Following the 2019 reorganisation and a subsequent delimitation exercise completed in 2020, the structure of the legislative assembly was significantly altered. The total number of seats was increased to 114, with the original 24 seats reserved for PoK remaining vacant. Of the remaining 90 contested seats, the delimitation report added six seats to the Jammu division and one to the Kashmir division, resulting in a new distribution of 47 seats for the Kashmir division and 43 for the Jammu division. This change also introduced provisions for the reservation of 7 seats for the Scheduled Castes and 9 for the Scheduled Tribes, marking a major shift in the region’s electoral landscape. Now, the nominations by an unelected executive to an elected house are Jammu and Kashmir’s new political battle. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.",

Former Member of Parliament (MP)Rahul Shewaleof the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) has moved the Bombay High Court challenging the decision of a special court which refused to issue summons to a witness in an ongoing trial in the criminal defamation case he has filed against Shiv Sena chiefUddhav Thackerayand Rajya Sabha parliamentarianSanjay Raut. Notably, Shewale has filed the criminal defamation case after an article was published in Sena mouthpiece'Saamana'on December 29, 2022 pertaining to his alleged real estate dealings in Karachi, Pakistan. The former MP from South-Central Mumbai Constituency has filed the case against Thackeray, who is the Chief Editor and Raut, who is the Executive Editor ofSaamna. A Metropolitan Magistrate on October 26, 2023 hadrefused to discharge Thackeray and Rautfrom the case, who had contended that they were being implicated in the case. The said order, denying to discharge the two top politicians from Maharashtra, was upheld by a special MP/MLA court on September 23, 2024. Shewale had on July 8, 2025 filed an application before the trial court, urging it to issue summons to the news reporters ofSaamna- bothHindiandMarathieditions. However, the said summons were received by one Datta Hargude atSaamnaoffice. Two subsequent applications were filed urging the court to issue summons to Hargude and to produce some relevant documents. A further directive was sought to Thackeray and Raut to furnish the addresses of its news reporters, who had filed the defamatory article. However, the trial court by an order based on July 19, 2025 dismissed the said application filed by Shewale on the ground that the documents which the complainant seek to bring on record through Hargude, were 'self-incriminating' documents and thus Thackeray and Raut cannot be asked to produce the said documents in the court. Challenging this very order, Shewale has now approached single-judgeJustice Shriram Modakthrough his lawyer Chitra Salunkhe. In his petition, Shewale has contended that the trial court wrongly dismissed his plea as the documents that were sought to be brought on record, were not self-incriminatory and rather a best piece of evidence which could prove the complainant's case against Thackeray and Raut. The plea was listed for hearing on Wednesday (August 20) but due to paucity of time, it could not be take up for hearing and was adjourned till next month. The petition is likely to be mentioned again on Friday through Salunkhe, who confirmed that she would be urging for an earlier date for hearing the instant petition.

        "description": "Agni V test signals India shift : Less to endure , more to prevail in future conflicts – Firstpost",
        "raw_text": "India’s latest test of the Agni-V missile is not a mere technical exercise or a photo-op headline. It is a blunt reminder that India is no longer a power limited by geography or caution. For decades, our nuclear deterrent was geared towards Pakistan, with only partial coverage of Chinese territory. That era is gone. India has moved from strategic restraint to strategic assertion. With Agni-V, Beijing, Shanghai, and every critical hub in China now sit squarely within range. Pakistan, with its geography, was, in any case, home ground for such a punishment. The map of Asia has been redrawn. This is no routine missile. It is India’sBrahmastra— decisive, devastating, and impossible to ignore. With Agni-V, India has entered an era of proactive and pre-emptivecold strikecapability much more devastating than what was exhibited on the night of 9/10 May at Nur Khan Pakistan Air Force base and adjoining areas. The aim is to deter, defeat and cripple any misadventure, with AGNI_V being an instrument of deterrence in peace and a force of decision in war. Beyond Data Points On paper, the numbers are staggering: a range between 5,500 and 8,000 kilometres, a payload capacity of 1.5 tonnes, three-stage solid fuel propulsion, and re-entry speeds that touchMach 24. Fired from Abdul Kalam Island, it can hit deep inside adversary territory in minutes. It can carry lighter warheads for extended reach, navigate mid-course corrections, and shrug off interception attempts. But numbers, while impressive, do not capture the psychological shift. Agni-V forces every hostile war room — whether in Beijing or Islamabad — to live with a new reality: there is no safe distance anymore. Deterrence is not about physics; it is about psychology. Agni-V changes the enemy’s mind before it changes the battlefield. From Cold Start to Cold Strike For years, India’s planners debated the “Cold Start” doctrine, a plan to launch swift conventional incursions against Pakistan before the nuclear threshold was crossed. It looked elegant on paper but remained an ambitious military concept with little politico-military harmony. Mobilisation delays, political hesitation, and international pressure made it almost impossible. Agni-V pushes India into a different space altogether: Cold Strike. Not divisions of tanks rolling across borders. Not weeks of build-up. But deep, precise, almost instantaneous blows at the adversary’s most critical strategic assets — command, control infrastructure, strategic assets, and airbases. The power to deliver a decisive strike within minutes of a launch order. That is not a theory. That is Cold Strike. Deterrence, Finally Whole Deterrence works only if the enemy believes two things: that you have the capability to destroy him, and that you will not hesitate if pushed. Earlier, gaps in India’s reach gave China reason to gamble. That illusion is gone. Agni-V covers every Chinese target that matters. It restores equilibrium. Even under India’s statedNo First Usedoctrine, retaliation is now beyond question. Any nuclear strike against India guarantees annihilation in return, a certainty no adversary can intercept or absorb. It slams shut the space for reckless adventurism. Built to Survive and Kill Launching a missile is easy. Delivering it through hostile skies is the real challenge. Agni-V is built to survive. Its advanced guidance allows evasive manoeuvres mid-course. Its countermeasures confuse radars. At Mach 24 re-entry speeds, even the most advanced missile defence shields cannot promise interception. And this is only the baseline. Future versions will likely carryMIRVs — Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles. One missile, many warheads, each aimed at different targets. For an adversary, that is a nightmare. Even if one gets intercepted, others will rain down. Lethality with Choice A 1.5-tonne payload with a nuclear warhead option provides it with teeth. India could launchcounter-value strikes, hitting cities and crippling civilian infrastructure. Equally, it could executecounter-force missions, knocking out enemy nuclear facilities, missile silos, or command centres. The ambiguity is the deterrent. No enemy planner can ever be sure how India will respond. That uncertainty breeds caution. Agni-V is as much a shield as it is a sword. It deters by its very existence, assuring citizens that India cannot be cornered or restrained. It is India’s Brahmastra, a weapon of power. In India’s mythology, Brahmastra is a supreme, divine weapon of mass destruction produced by Lord Brahma. It is an earthly rocket that has the ability to destroy whole armies and result in devastating effects. Agni-V embodies that same spirit. Silent until needed. Decisive when unleashed. Preparing for Tomorrow’s Wars The future battlefield will be unlike anything seen before — cyber intrusions, space-based targeting, hypersonic glide weapons. Yet one constant remains: nations that can guarantee devastating retaliation command respect. With Agni-V, India guarantees exactly that. Agni-VI, already whispered about, will go further: MIRVs, longer reach, and possible sea-based deployment from nuclear submarines. That would complete India’s nuclear triad — land, sea, and air delivery systems. No adversary could hope to neutralise it. Survivability will be absolute. Add India’s advances in space surveillance, AI-enabled targeting, and cyber resilience, and the picture is clear: this is not just a missile. It is the cornerstone of a deterrence architecture meant to last decades. The Message to the World Missile tests are never domestic affairs. They are global statements. To adversaries, Agni-V signals that coercion will fail and that intimidation will backfire. To partners, it underlines India’s arrival as a power that shapes, not follows. At a time of turbulence, Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, Russian gambles in Europe, and shifting sands in West Asia, credibility comes from capability, not communiqués. Agni-V is credibility cast in metal and fire. A Nation Ready to Prevail The successful test of Agni-V is not about vanity projects or military showmanship. It is about survival. It is about confidence. It tells Indians that their nation is prepared, not just to endure, but to prevail. For too long, we lived with doubts about range, gaps in deterrence, and vulnerabilities in posture. Agni-V wipes those doubts away. It ensures that in the stormy decades ahead, India will not be cornered, blackmailed, or coerced. If war is forced upon it, India will stand its ground. And if pushed beyond, it will strike back cold, precise, and devastating. Agni-V sharpens the sword. It strengthens the shield. It is India’s ultimate answer to the uncertainties of a dangerous century. The author is former Director General, Mechanised Forces.
